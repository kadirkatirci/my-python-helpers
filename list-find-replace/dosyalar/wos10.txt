TI The Latest Instalment in the Whig Interpretation of Australian Education
   History: Catherine Byrne's JORH Article "Free, Compulsory and (not)
   Secular"
SO JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB The original meaning of the term secular in the free compulsory and secular nineteenth-century Australian public education acts is often contested, and has recently become part of a contemporary debate about the presence of confessional religion in state schools. I outline four different interpretations expressed in Australian education history writing, then review the recent Journal of Religious History article Free, Compulsory and (not) Secular by Catherine Byrne, arguing that it belongs to the secular liberal or Whig interpretation of the meaning of secular in the acts. The article is critiqued for forcing sources to conform to an overly rhetorical narrative device: a polarised structure valorising Victorian legislator George Higinbotham, and demonising New South Wales legislator Sir Henry Parkes. The article is also criticised for sub-optimal source-work, lack of awareness of the corpus of Australian education history, and overt contemporary policy agendas. I also suggest that the larger Whig interpretation of secular as part of a liberal progress narrative, underemphasises a religious hermeneutic and a critical theory hermeneutic: that a Protestant consensus about state schooling and secular in the Public Education Acts was also a deeply sectarian device for excluding Catholics from a dominant social settlement, just one part of a systemically divided and prejudicial culture.

AB Faith and beliefs about living and dying are fundamental constituents of spiritual development. However, children are seldom asked to talk about their experiences of life and death. This article has a twofold purpose. It first describes children's expressions on living and dying, as heard during a newly developed programme which encourages children's participation as active subjects of their spiritual journey. This programme, the Grande Halte, began in 2004 within the changing context of Christian religious education in a secular Quebec. Secondly, it proposed a theological reflection informed by the social sciences and the social context of the milieu, and based on children's expressions. It suggests that stories and symbols are needed in order to develop a coherent horizon of meaning in one's life. The relational dimension of the process is also highlighted.

SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY

DT Article
DE Sovereignty; Danish West Indies; legal practice; delegated legal
   authority; philosophy of law; colonial state formation
AB This article examines conceptions of sovereignty in the Danish Caribbean colony of St. Thomas between 1672 and 1680. It focuses on the colony's first governor, Jorgen Iversen, and his struggles to govern the colony on behalf of Denmark's absolutist monarchy and the Danish West India and Guinea Company. Using insights from recent studies of sovereignty and power in colonial societies, the article explores how Iversen organized the colony's legal system as a means of creating legitimate rule and as a way of transferring the sovereignty of the Danish monarch across the Atlantic. By demonstrating that colonization was a profoundly political project, the article challenges existing historiographical interpretations of early colonial rule that have mainly focused on the economics of Danish Atlantic expansion and the allegedly chaotic and unruly nature of St. Thomas's colonial society. More generally, the article provides new insights into the study of sovereignty and authority in the formation of Caribbean colonial societies.

   Scientific Thought
SO ASSYRIAN AND BABYLONIAN SCHOLARLY TEXT CATALOGUES: MEDICINE, MAGIC AND
   DIVINATION
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Traditional accounts of Babylonian medicine see the two disciplines involved in healing in ancient Mesopotamia, viz. asiputu "exorcism or incantation-and-ritual-driven healing" and asutu "medicine", as complementary disciplines, collaborating in the treatment of individual patients. Ritter's 1965 paper on the two disciplines, for example, sought to differentiate them, while at the same time arguing that they often collaborated in the treatment of individual patients. The new edition of AMC in this volume already overturns one of Ritter's primary working hypotheses, namely that Babylonian medicine (asutu) lacked the type of carefully organized, discipline-defining compendium known for asiputu, where The Diagnostic Handbook clearly plays this role. Now that The Nineveh Medical Compendium - the medical corpus that AMC defines - can be seen as functionally equivalent, in certain ways, to The Diagnostic Handbook, this paper seeks to overturn two other common descriptions of Babylonian medicine that derive, however indirectly, from the idea that the medical corpus is amorphous or open-ended: (i) the belief that asutu and asiputu were complementary and cooperative disciplines and (ii) the supposedly non-theoretical character of Babylonian medicine (asutu).
   This paper argues that these two disciplines were, for the most part, in competition for the attention of the crown as well as for social standing more generally. Each of these two disciplines (asutu and asiputu) maintained its own disciplinary identity and compendia and, perhaps more importantly for Mesopotamian intellectual history, its own models of disease etiology and causation. These different models of etiology and causation in asutu and asiputu only become apparent, however, when we adopt a properly "architectonic" approach to reconstructing the technical compendia that were used by each of these two disciplines. And, as a consequence, the position of any given line or fragment within a particular, discipline-specific compendium is one of its most important, even definitive, properties. This type of "architectonic approach" is unusually powerful, when we look at the diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, because there we find a decisive split. The etiologies of gastrointestinal disease within exorcism-driven healing (asiputu) rely, almost exclusively, on postulating ghosts or demons as causal agents, while Babylonian medicine (asutu) turned to increasingly "secular" etiologies based on analogies between the unseen processes of the gastrointestinal tract and visible processes in the natural or social world. These distinctively secular etiologies in the medical corpus are registered, above all, in medical incantations that parody the established incantations of the competing discipline of asiputu.(1)

AB In 1896, when Abraham Cahan's collection of new Americans encouraged his greenhorn Gitl to remove her wig-which sits on her head as the metonymic symbol of religious ritual and thus Old World shame-readers of Yekl were offered an account of twentieth-century American progress, rendered necessary (if painful). Just as Yekl/Jake shaved his earlocks and beard, so Gitl must give up her Jewish wig and stand before the world in her 'own hair'. But we might imagine the necessity of such a sacrifice has become obsolete in twenty-first-century America, particularly as we see that what the grandmother doffed, the granddaughter comes to don. Beginning with a revival of religious themes in the 1980s, heralded by Cynthia Ozick, Jewish American literature is now rich with narratives centered on secular characters becoming Orthodox; on the inner-worlds of insular Orthodox communities; and on reimagining the potential of Orthodoxy within the context of Americanness. Interestingly, most of these narratives have been written by women, and it is the experiences of Jewish American women-the latter-day Gitls-that are foregrounded.
   Despite the proliferation of such narratives, it is important to recognize that the choice to embrace religion (made visible through wigs and shpitzels, turbans and kerchiefs) continues to be fraught. The increasingly popular 'off-the-derech', or ex-Orthodox, memoirs of the twenty-first century identify the Jewish sheitel, like the Muslim veil, as a symbol of oppression, and the act of uncovering (like unveiling) a tale of feminist triumph.
   Still, looking at a range of fiction, including Allegra Goodman's Kaaterskill Falls (1998), Nathan Englander's short story 'The Wig' (2007), and Naomi Ragen's satire, The Saturday Wife (2007), we find the multivalent appearance and complexity of Jewish American women's head coverings in recent literature suggest a different and varied signification, and a more nuanced negotiation between religious and national values. This is significant because it is allows readers to see how seemingly comprehensive religious communities, which could be marked as a form of 'counter-cosmopolitanism' in the words of Kwame Anthony Appiah, actually engage with the broader spectrum of American culture, which in turn is able to both accommodate the communities and alter itself through the accommodation.

DE Elizabeth Bishop; Yvor Winters; Louis L. Martz; Meditative Lyric; the
   Secular; George Herbert; Christian Platonism; Augustine; modern poetry
AB Elizabeth Bishop's poetry has won the admiration of a number of Christian poets and scholars. This essay argues that one reason for this is Bishop's subtle engagement with the work of the poet-divines Gerard Manley Hopkins and, especially, George Herbert; through their influence, she enters into the guiding western poetic tradition of the meditative lyric, which is rooted in the Platonic and Christian accounts of the human person as an image of the Triune God in virtue of the mind as a trinity of memory, understanding, and will. Bishop practiced poetry as a moral act open to a divinity it cannot account for or even name, but traces of whose significance run through the world her poems depict. By considering her work, and her poem "The Weed" in particular, in the context of Herbert, the historical studies of Louis L. Martz, and the literary theory of Yvor Winters, we see that Bishop the unbeliever cannot properly be understood as a "secular" poet, but as one who recognizes the meditative lyric as a way of arriving at understanding of a truth that transcends us.

My contribution to the debate on congregations is to study priests as complex social actors whose role is not limited to their religious activities, but who also act as true negotiators, intermediaries and political agents in the villages. To explore this, I analyse the case of Juan Gonzalez de Urbina, a priest in Atlacomulco and key figure behind the unpublished document of the Atlacomulco congregation.

AB The contemporary debate over secularization for the most part belongs to sociology of religion. Among classical sociologists, Western secularization has been generally interpreted as a process of decline of the relevance and influence of religion (Comte), of its demise as an illusion oppressive of the proletariat (Marx), of its transformation into a "religion of man" (Durkheim), or of relocation into a narrower sphere due to rationalization (Weber). At the present, it is possible to formulate an ideal type of three groups of theories involved in the conversation. The orthodox model affirms the project of modernity unavoidably erodes religion and marginalizes it, particularly because science and pluralism discredit religious world-views. On an opposite end, the rational choice model sees secularization as fostering religious vitality due to the establishment of a "free religious market" in which religious organizations compete with each other. The debate between these positions has been strong and has led to an excessive focus on the relationship between religious freedom and religious vitality. The third group takes a different approach by criticizing the first one without espousing the thesis of the second. Although scholars in this group have different views, they all share an understanding of secularization as meaning religious change, without necessarily entailing decline nor revitalization. It is among the latter that we find Charles Taylor's meta-narrative of Western secularization. An important feature of his approach is that it constitutes the application of his philosophical ideas on the human person and on the method of the social sciences.

AB Since the time of Aristotle, the character of Antigone in Sophocles' play of the same name has been cited as an example of natural law, in her appeal to the gods to justify her defiance of the law of the polis represented by Creon. With reference to interpretations of Antigone offered by Costas Douzinas and Ronnie Warrington and by Jacques Lacan, I challenge the association between Antigone and natural law, particularly with regard to the representation of women, rights and law. I argue that a feminist retrieval of the scholastic natural law tradition might off er a more holistic and integrated concept of female personhood in the context of human flourishing, natural reason and the goodness of nature. I conclude by considering Olympe de Gouges' Declaration des Droits de la Femme et de la Citoyenne, as an example of an appeal for women's rights and sexual equality informed by pre-modern concepts of natural law.

ID TRAJECTORIES
AB The rapid rise of those identifying as 'non-religious' across many countries has prompted growing interest in the 'religious nones'. A now burgeoning literature has emerged, challenging the idea that 'non-religion' is the mere absence of religion and exploring the substantive beliefs, practices and identities that are associated with so-called unbelief. Yet we know little about the micro-processes through which this cultural shift towards non-religion is taking place. Drawing on data from an ethnographic study, this article examines how, when, where and with whom children learn to be non-religious, and considers the different factors that are implicated in the formation of non-religious identities. While research on religious transmission has demonstrated the importance of the family, our multi-sited approach reveals the important role also played by both school context and children's own reflections in shaping their formation as non-religious, suggesting a complex pattern of how non-religious socialization is occurring in Britain today.

DT Article
DE adaptation; sacral buildings; semantic architecture; narrative research
AB Sacral objects are an important part of Europe's religious heritage. For centuries, temples have constituted a key element in the urban morphology; they fit into the urban fabric of European cities and are permanently embedded there. Due to the current laicization of Europe, the adaptation of sacred buildings into secular functions has become a necessity for economic reasons. Their owners, architects, conservators and historians are faced with a dilemma: whether to preserve an object or transform it into another function? Places of worship cannot be considered in solely economic terms due to the identity of the place, its current function and its symbolism. Sacred spaces, apart from their function, structure and form, also have meaning. In holy sites, the symbol becomes a narrative tool. The purpose of a narrative in the cultural context is related to the site, the narrator, the recipient and the time of the narrative. Narrative research into semantic architecture, as one of the means of researching sacred architecture, has potential both in analysis and as a tool to facilitate design processes for the appropriate transformation of sacred buildings to serve secular functions.

SO ETUDES ANGLAISES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article focuses on the idea, repeatedly reasserted in the second tetralogy, of the impossibility of refounding trust in the political order after the initial "sin" of the deposition of Richard II by Bolingbroke-trust being defined in Georg Simmel's sense as the possibility of investing in a future that can be expected to be the continuation of the present. 2 Henry IV shows a feudal society poised on the cusp of modernity, presenting a particularly acute moment of the aporia of trust in the political sphere. It posits both the necessity of faith to establish a stable form of order and the impossibility of guaranteeing the latter on solid grounds. Although it is not known whether Shakespeare had read Machiavelli, it has often been remarked that he includes some intriguing echoes of The Prince. What seems to have gone unnoticed is that Machiavelli's treatise offers a particularly pertinent analysis of the problem of political trust, issuing a series of recommendations to quell the crisis of trust in "new" principalities. This article follows up this lead to analyse the manifestations of the crisis of trust and of its problematic resolution in 2 Henry IV in the light of Machiavelli.

AB Religion and politics are the two ancient social institutions which propose, each in its own way, a notion of how to live in this world. Since both of them structure the social living of people they are everywhere interactive. The constant interaction of politics and religion in different countries gives birth to diverse forms of political and religious co-habitations and there emerges consequent issues revolving their identities, methods of reaching out to people and means of their survival. This paper explains the rationale of the inevitable alliance between politics and religion, exposes the important models of politics and religion co-existing in the current world and examines the potential of religion to withstand the attempts of politics to overwhelm religion. It also envisages that the emerging cold war between secular and religious nationalisms will not result in disastrous casualties.

DE Development; Disenchantment; Agency; Worldview
AB The fact that development discourse is dominated by the Western categorisation of 'developed' and 'developing' nations indicates the hegemony of the West when it comes to understandings of development. While this understanding can be contested it is hardly appropriate to change the rules of the game when it comes to benchmarks of development in terms of standards of living, longevity and health. What must be contested, however, is the notion that all countries must follow the same paths that lead to a state of development. Charles Taylor's seminal work on secularisation suggests, following Weber, that development in the West was accompanied by secularisation which, in turn, followed the pattern of disenchantment of the universe, the removal of God, and the shift from a transcendent to an imminent frame. The expectation is that African countries will follow the same route if development is to take place. This has not happened, as Parsons' work in the Zambian copper industry indicates. Therefore development theorists need to take cognisance of the 'spiritual' realities of an African worldview.

AB This work traces the evolution of Jewish representation(s) of Europe since the Emancipation, focusing on the cultural image of Europe among the Eastern-European Jewish intelligentsia, in relation with the process of building a modern, national Jewish identity. The author mentions the idea of "abandoning" Europe which occured in the Zionist ideology and in the post-Holocaust Israeli public discourse due to the impact of modern political antisemitism, and to the influence of the European national ideologies. This study discusses the new tendencies of the Israeli society and culture to "rediscover" Europe and to re-build the cultural and spiritual bridges between Israel and the postcommunist Eastern Europe. Outlined in their recent books, the perspectives of two outstanding Israeli writers, such as Amos Oz and Aharon Appelfeld, are used, here, to exemplify this new approach.

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR RELIGIONS-UND GEISTESGESCHICHTE
LA German
DT Article
AB Baha'i law diffferentiates between a secular and a sacred legal sphere, intertwining both by positing a religious duty for its adherents to abide by secular (state) law. In Germany, it encounters a secular legal framework that aims at something similar - creating an equilibrium between state law and religious law by establishing the principle of the division of State and Religion, while at the same time facilitating religious freedom; it provides a secular justif.ication for the recognition of religious law. With this, both orders provide mechanisms ensuring that state law and religious law are able to enforce their own claim of validity, while at the same time avoiding conflicts between the respective legal orders. The article argues that this unique interaction between Baha'i law and the German constitutional law framework impacted both legal orders. For German law, on the one hand, it proved to be crucial for the development and opening of this legal f.ield - whose original purpose was the regulation of the relationship between the state and the (two) Christian churches - for other religious traditions. The interaction with state law has impacted the Baha'i Community of Germany, on the other hand, by catalyzing a number of developments that in other comparative law contexts have been dubbed "constitutionalization" efffects.

AB This article examines comparative analysis of the most deep-seated form of the radical religious thinking in the Western Civilization, that is, the views of radical or the Death-of-God theologians Gabriel Vahanian, Thomas Altizer, William Hamilton, Paul van Buren and Harvey Cox. All of the representatives of this theological or religious-philosophical stream are radical religious thinkers who have focused on a number of fundamental issues related to Christian religion which have formulated the thematic commonalities in their problematic. However, the differences have come forth from the interpretation of these issues as they have viewed the same phenomenon from different aspects. These fundamental issues can be united around the following ideas: issues of relations between the idea of and reality of God, transcenddent-immanent, theology-Christology and religious-secular which have posed a challenge to the institutional Christianity as well as become a serious hindrance between the latter and a contemporary secular human being and the society.

AB This article analyses how faith-based civil society organisations have advocated the value-add of faith to governmental and non-governmental development actors in the highly secularised context of the Netherlands. Its social value lies in the space for reflexivity it opens up on how the religious and the secular are entangled in the field of development through shifting the gaze towards secularised Europe. Its academic value lies in how it combines the study of faith and development, with a critical analysis of the secular formations in which much of the thinking around faith and development is shaped. The article builds on an academic study of and long-term engagement with the Dutch non-governmental organisation (NGO)-based Knowledge Centre Religion and Development (KCRD), offering a critical overview of the KCRD's work between 2006 and 2016. Data were gathered through interviews, document analysis and participant observation as part of the academic research, as well as informal observations and analysis through professional engagement. The KCRD, because of its institutional setting, had to adopt an instrumental approach towards the role of religion in development, which prevented it from challenging the reigning secular paradigm in development and its biases towards faith-based actors. The article will recommend that future initiatives on faith and development more consciously anchor their approach to faith in their institutional practices and mainstream discussions on the European continent.

TI Freedom of Conscience and Freedom of Religion within the Context of
   Human Security and Authenticity in Vito Mancuso's Lay Secular Theology
SO NEUE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SYSTEMATISCHE THEOLOGIE UND RELIGIONSPHILOSOPHIE
LA English
DT Article
DE freedom; conscience; religion; security; authenticity
AB Vito Mancuso, one of Italy's most famous intellectuals and author of best-selling books on religion - such as L'anima e il suo destino [The Soul and Its Destiny] (2007) and Io e Dio. Una guida dei perplessi [I and God. A Guide for the Perplexed] (2011) - is a secular theologian and philosopher of religion who promotes an anti-traditional understanding of Christianity aimed at lay people influenced by contemporary secular ideas. Mancuso's influence appears to have reached a pinnacle since he is present in the media with various TV and internet interviews as well as articles published in famous Italian newspapers such as La Repubblica and Corriere della sera. Moreover, his book The Soul and Its Destiny (2007) has been sold in over two hundred thousand copies which is a record for a theological work by any standards. Since he is still unknown to the English-speaking world, this paper investigates Mancuso's notion of freedom, particularly freedom of conscience and freedom of religion, in the general context of his religious philosophy which focuses on the concept of soul. In Mancuso, a Catholic by (his own) confession, reality is essentially material, so everything which exists in the world and the universe is part of this material reality. The human being is no exception, thus its natural constitution is thoroughly material. Everything pertaining to the human being, including the idea of soul, is material. However, the fact that ideas, such as the soul, can be conceived within the materiality of the human being is indicative of the latter's capacity for spiritualization; consequently, spirituality is also part of and constitutive of materiality. Hence, Mancuso's belief that the soul is material, and so is everything traditionally accepted as spiritual, including ideas such as God and freedom. Since freedom can be connected to matter and materiality through the concept of soul, Mancuso argues that the reality of freedom is innate in every human being; men and women, however, must become aware of it and then live it out in their daily lives by promoting as well as defending freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. Both types of freedom are compulsory not only for the good of humankind in general, for peace, and security, but also for every particular human being who can lead an authentic life only by practicing freedom of conscience and freedom of religion without fearing repression of any sort.

AB The education for citizenship cannot ignore the existence of religions, considering its strong presence and role within society. Its study within a secular public school context will be did as a field of knowledge, which will require an epistemological foundation, guaranteeing theoretically and methodologically speaking, a clear sense of formation. As a cultural object, religion will be studied as a religious phenomenon through a scientific approach that does not reduce it only to its visual and material aspects, but which actually retrieves social manifestations and senses for the religious people. The french educational system of religious facts, even though it is considered as a transversal subject throughout Humanities, contributes a lot to the debate in Brazil around the construction of an epistemological basis to the discipline of religious teaching.

The philosophy of its imprisonment based on solitary confinement was the object of an international debate on how to rehabilitate criminals. In the discussion, arguments were deeply informed by the theological perspectives. This essay uncovers the theological foundations of solitary confinement and discusses its legitimacy.

AB The introduction of German state-church law in 1919 ended the thousand-year Christian state system by separating the state and church and providing comprehensive guarantees for the freedom of religion as well as equality for all religious communities. In rejecting state control, enforced conformity, and the elimination of religion - three versions of secularisation arising from the ideas of the French Revolution, left-wing Hegelians and Marxists, and twentieth century totalitarian systems - it embodies the reasoning and sense behind 1849's Constitution of St. Paul's Church, 1919's Weimar Constitution, 1949's Basic Law and its affirmation in 1990, and determines how state-church law is shaped in a liberal cultural and social state. The origin and continuity of the law, its breadth and depth, are only revealed in the context of Luther's teachings on creation and redemption, law and Gospel, and with the development of an equal church law in the confessional age.

AB Some people clearly do think of humanism as being a kind of creed or value system. The first "humanist manifesto" published in 1933 talked of humanism as a "new religion". Nowhere does this idea ring more true than at weekend meetings of Ethical Societies in chilly and austere halls which can resemble Methodist chapels or Christian Scientist temples. It's hard to resist the cheap shot that a lot of what has passed for atheistical humanism has been a kind of non-conformism without the hymns.

AB The two reviewed books belong to a series of "Studies in Religion, Secular Beliefs and Human Rights" published by Martinus Nijhoff. Both constitute a significant contribution to the literature on religion and human rights that developed in the last decade, after many years of neglect of the subject. Both are collective books and the outcome of international conferences. They deal with diverse aspects of the interaction between religion and human rights and international law. A recurrent question is to what extent has religion influenced human rights or if these are a post World War II and post-Holocaust phenomenon, strictly secular. Does God Believe in Human Rights? contains an introduction and 14 essays. The volume Religion, Human Rights and International Law is subtitled A Critical Examination of Islamic State Practices, a subject to which a considerable part of the volume is devoted. It contains 18 individual contributions, in addition to introductory reflections by the editors.

DE Jude; 2 Peter; Paul; non-canonical; acculturation; missiology
AB The force of culture can be, at times, unbearable for Christian leaders, preachers, and practitioners, often manifesting itself in problematic ways at the interface between the church and society in the conduct of liturgical services, such as the pastoral offices (funerals, weddings) and also Sunday worship. An issue of some consternation and concern is very frequently the manner in which, and the extent to which, cultural elements, such as those drawn from the worlds of literature, music, the arts, cinema and television, may have a role in Christian liturgy and preaching. It is helpful then, to look to the New Testament for guidance and example, especially in the light of the return of Christianity to something akin to the margins of its cultural world, reflecting more accurately than has been the case for many centuries, the actual socio-cultural context of the New Testament. To this end, helpful examples are to be found in the use of a common underlying, yet 'non-canonical' tradition, shared by both the writer and recipients in the short epistle of Jude, together with the citation of secular poets and philosophers by Paul in the context of both reported speech (in the Acts) and the epistles.

AB This paper brings out the findings of a noteworthy work that contributes with new perceptions in relation to the secularization process of the Colombian judicial oath along the nineteenth century. Based on primary and secondary sources, it examines the oath's worth as a guarantor of truth within the cultural purpose's framework of judicial process. It also reflects on the political and judicial evolution of oath in Modernity, and recalls its slow development from the religious practice of oath towards the secularized pledge, inside the Colombian ' s judicial proceedings. In addition, it makes known the strong relationship between religion and the procedural oath; therefore contributing to the identification of the most important characteristic of the jurisprudence practices existing in the nineteenth-century.

SO JEWISH STUDIES QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
DE Zionism; Revisionism; right-wing; Israel
ID JUDAISM
AB Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the founder of Revisionist Zionism, is largely portrayed in the research literature as a committed or even radical secularist. In this view, it was his successor as leader of the movement, Menachem Begin, who brought a pro-religious dimension into right-wing Zionist ideology, a combination that continues to be influential today in Israel's ruling party, Likud. This essay argues that, while Jabotinsky was and remained alienated from traditional observance, his attitude toward religious - as spirituality, or religiosity - and its role in national societies began to change in the 1930s. The metamorphosis was spurred by the rise of racism and prejudice in European national movements. Jabotinsky came to believe that religious values needed to be understood, and could be used, as a spiritual moor to bolster the human spirit, and instill moral and liberal values.

ID SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; POLYGAMY; LAW
AB Religion plays an important role in today's multicultural society, especially when it comes to religious rights for minorities. Granting these rights stems from an endeavour to transcend a politics of tolerance, even a politics of respect, and to treat them in terms of a politics of recognition. Assigning these rights implies that some principles need to be critically reflected upon: the individualistic interpretation of minority rights, the separationist interpretation of the separation between church and state, the secularist interpretation of religious freedom, and the uniformistic interpretation of the state's legal unity. In granting minorities religious rights, one comes across the importance of their personal law, including marriage law and family law. To incorporate such personal law into the legal systems of Western society, one could apply the distinction between the domains of status demarcation, that refers to entering and belonging to a community, and property distribution, that relates to the rights and duties implicit in these social bonds. The former may be provided for by religious law, the later, by secular law. However, the question is whether marriage under religious law, and rights and duties under secular law can solve the problems women suffer from, especially in the case of polygyny.

AB Over the last few decades historians have been rediscovering Australia's religious heritage, often in response to entrenched narratives depicting Australia's social, intellectual, and political history as a triumph of secular enlightenment over vestiges of Old World partnerships of religion, state, and society. That Australia has a rich secular heritage is indisputable, but to draw a sharp distinction between the secular and the religious is anachronistic and misguided, and any attempt to tell the story of Australia's secular heritage must acknowledge that the secular often found its justification flowing from more general religious premises grounded in enlightenment ideals such as rational religion, rational piety, and general Christianity. Indeed, when liberal democracy was emerging in the colonies the secular had to be justified in terms acceptable to the public square and these terms were broadly religious. Robert Lowe is an apt case study for divining the nature of the secular in colonial Australia, for his thought and political activity show the subtle and complex way that ideals such as enlightenment, religion, and secular entered into dialogue rather than warfare with one another and contributed to social institutions judged suitable for a fledgling pluralist nation.

AB Nowadays, man has been transformed from animal rationale and animal symbolicum into homo videns, and this state of affairs determines the tools at the disposal of religious institutions to carry out the work of new evangelisation, to contest global secularisation, or to point out the correct moral solutions from a Christian point of view to the problems of today's civilisation. Religious advertising is just such a new tool of information and persuasion. It is one of the elements of communication aimed at promoting values, ideas, services and shaping attitudes and behaviours appropriate to a given religion. It contains certain elements of the sacrum and aims to make recipients aware of their spiritual needs, arouse the desire to satisfy them and indicate the attractiveness of Christianity. It is supposed to create appropriate preferences, show the beauty and positive image of the sender and the "product" that faith provides. A specific type of advertising is a billboard campaign. Poland is the most Catholic country in Europe. At the same time, it ranks first in terms of the rate of secularisation among young people. In Poland, at the turn of 2020/2021, we had an anti-abortion billboard campaign, which was the result of the long-standing policy of the conservative ruling camp against various forms of contemporary secularisation and global secular ideologies. The campaign proved to be controversial and ineffective. The aim of this article is to describe the specifics of social advertising in the context of the issues discussed on the example of the Polish anti-abortion campaign.

AB The Spanish society of the Counter-Reformation was put together by the growth and proliferation of religious congregations of all kinds. The Holy School of Christ arises within this atmosphere as a new element imported from Italy, where there were some similar institutions. In this way, the School of Christ intends to dignify the secular side of Catholicism in the midst of a common opinion inclined to the regular clergy life as the only way to achieve holiness. Furthermore, the School used to be a very popular and particular institution which developed its own rites and an inscrutable misterious climate. Because of that, it was present throughout the Spanish geography, including Granadian territory where also developed peculiar aspects that still remain.

AB Contemporary transformations in the dominant forms of religion in global context are analyzed in terms of a change from a dominance of a Westphalian modeling of religious and political systems to a post-Westphalian condition in which Westphalian modeling loses its self-evidence and gives way to a greater modeling of religion on other societal systems, especially the systems for mass information media and economy. Recent changes in sociological observation of religion are analyzed in terms of this transformation.

AB This is Part I of a triptych. It addresses the latent potential of the imagination in constructing a sense of identity. Included is the role of faith in overcoming the obstacles presented by a social imaginary dominated by literal idolatry that leads to unnecessary suffering. The initial foundation examines the process of growth and the role that the imagination plays in the construction of narrative identity-an important part of human development. Literal idolatry interrupts this original process through the creation of a social imaginary that corrupts natural measures for self-correction. At the same time, a creative faith contains the capacity to dislodge the rigid boundaries of literal idolatry. A creative faith narrative identities in ways that open beyond simple coherence and completeness. It can also revitalize social institutions and public spaces. The argument concludes by arguing fictional narratives augment the work of theology in grounding and inspiring creative faith.

AB The two reviewed books belong to a series of "Studies in Religion, Secular Beliefs and Human Rights" published by Martinus Nijhoff. Both constitute a significant contribution to the literature on religion and human rights that developed in the last decade, after many years of neglect of the subject. Both are collective books and the outcome of international conferences. They deal with diverse aspects of the interaction between religion and human rights and international law. A recurrent question is to what extent has religion influenced human rights or if these are a post World War II and post-Holocaust phenomenon, strictly secular. Does God Believe in Human Rights? contains an introduction and 14 essays. The volume Religion, Human Rights and International Law is subtitled A Critical Examination of Islamic State Practices, a subject to which a considerable part of the volume is devoted. It contains 18 individual contributions, in addition to introductory reflections by the editors.

AB Les groupements sectaires partagent generalement une representation demonisee de la societe seculiere en y referant comme etant le monde. Cette representation religieuse est suffisamment negative pour qu'on veuille rompre avec ses valeurs. En revanche, la definition accordee a la secte par les agents etatiques emane egalement d'une representation. Seculiere, elle apprehende la secte a partir de criteres de dangerosite en tentant de l'evincer de la sphere du religieux. Nous postulons que le conflit pouvant emaner de ces deux representations peut etre resolu par l'adoption, chez les intervenants, de l'approche comprehensive.
   Sectarian groups often share a demonized representation of secular society, referring to it as the World. This religious representation is negative enough for members to reject secular values. Yet, the definition of cults by state officials also derives from a representation. From this secular viewpoint, the sect is defined as dangerous and is perceived as an undesirable aspect of the religious landscape. We argue that conflicts that may result from these two representations may be resolved by having social workers adopt a comprehensive approach.

DE Japan's stagnation; the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to
   fall; monopoly capitalism; restrained investment; rises in profitability
AB Since the collapse of the bubble economy at the beginning of the 1990s, Japan has been in secular stagnation. Despite the stagnant economic conditions, the rate of profit has been rising, not falling. The coexistence of the rise in profitability and prolonged economic stagnation is a manifestation of the fundamental contradiction of present-day Japanese capitalism. Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (LTRPF) provides a consistent explanation regarding the paradoxical situation in Japan characterised not by a falling but a rising rate of profit. Meanwhile, this paper discusses the Monopoly Capitalism school, which has studied capitalist behaviour concerning productive investment and changes in the form of capitalist competition at the monopoly stage of capitalism. While the school's negation of the LTRPF is unacceptable, their notions may provide useful explanations as to why the rate of profit has risen under secular stagnation in Japan.

As a huge Romanesque religious building, it was erected in the 12(th) century following the rediscovery of various late medieval hagiographical traditions. Within a strong funerary and legendary tradition, it became the place where the clergy variously developed their activities, where parishioners would be buried in the hope of entering the next world, and where the local people attended religious and secular festivals, such as processions and dances, hull rituals, as well as a great variety of spectacles designed to highlight a mythicised image of the city and of the church itself.

TI READING JOHN PAUL II'S FIDES ET RATIO IN THE LIGHT OF JURGEN HABERMAS'
   POSTMETAPHYSICAL THINKING: TOWARDS A DIALOGUE WITH THE SECULAR WORLD
SO PHILOSOPHIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper suggests that the Encyclical Letter Fides et Ratio of John Paul II can be read today in the light of the so-called postmetaphysical thinking recommended by Jurgen Habermas, and doing this would lead the Catholic Church to a dialogue with the secular world. While being respectful to the autonomy of the philosophical disciplines, John Paul II makes an appeal to philosophers and all teachers of philosophy to courageously recover the proper end of every philosophical inquiry, that is, authentic wisdom and truth, including metaphysical truth. The encounter between faith and reason has always been a drama of separation and reconciliation. Becoming autonomous to the point of being a "godless discipline," the modern thought completely separated itself from revealed truth, cutting itself off from faith and theology. This was, in fact, the main point of the Enlightenment, that is, to release oneself from the clutches of religion. However, the revival of Catholic thought in the second half of the nineteenth century, as Edith Stein observes, opens a new possibility of finding a common meeting ground between the reborn Medieval philosophy and the newly created twentieth-century philosophy. Habermas' recommendation of a post-metaphysical thinking, which follows the concept of genealogy, has a role to play in the dialogue between religion and the secular world. Through dialogue, we can now promote an awareness of complementarity between the two sides. Hence, the appeal of John Paul II in Fides et Ratio finds new impetus to carry out this dialogue further and without fear.

AB The aim of this paper is to study the households of secular clergymen in the city of Murcia during the xvii and XVIII centuries. In order to achieve this two documents made for tax collection purposes will be used: a statement by ecclesiastics in 1667 and the book of families in 1756. The purpose is to analyse the family structures in which relatives were present. It was found that women predominated. It has been found that there were different reasons for the presence of relatives in the households of clergymen: from providing care and assistance or help with their studies, to helping out in domestic service.

TI ". . . But no wings buttress now": Selected poems in Antjie Krog's
   mede-wete read through the lens of autobiographical post-secular late
   work . . .
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
LA Afrikaans
DT Article
DE Antjie Krog; synapse; autobiography; late work; post-secularism;
   ecopsychology; spirituality; interconnectedness; holism
AB In Antjie Krog's collection of poetry, mede-wete (English translation, Synapse, by Karen Press)(1) there are a number of poems in which the author's search for a new kind of spirituality is articulated and in which the implicit longing for unity of all living things is suggested. Even before Socrates, philosophers speculated that wholes do indeed exist, but that their independently functioning parts are nothing but theoretical speculation. In modern physics, this concept is embodied in quantum field theory, which implies that everything that exists can be compared to waves at sea that cannot exist independently of the ocean. For the seeker of spiritual truth, the holistic path is a mystical path on which life reveals itself in its deeper meaning and "where our thoughts, feelings and actions are integrated by a clear intelligence and knowledge, and where a feeling of intimacy and participation with something greater than our normal selves occurs" (Ashraf 2012). In this manner the individual pursues so-called "higher knowledge".
   The purpose of this article is to suggest a theoretical paradigm on the basis of which the spiritual aspects in mede-wete can be discussed. I mainly rely on theories of autobiography as a spiritual practice, especially as an aspect of authors' "late work", post-secularism and ecopsychology when analysing a number of core poems, namely "moniaal", ("postulant"), "'n eland staan by 'n kuil" ("an eland stands at a pool"), "ongelowig is nie die regte woord nie" ("faithless is not the right word"), and "kerssonnet" ("christmas sonnet"). It can be argued that, in these poems, it becomes evident that rigid categories have lost their relevance in modern times. New categories have been imagined by the poet and phrased in poetic similes suggesting a larger whole in which plants, animals and people exist in interrelated and interdependent ways. In this way the boundaries of egocentrism by which modern people have been trapped are lifted, and existing religious boundaries are re-imagined through the creation of holism as a new reality - a reality that is greater than the sum of its individual elements; a liquid, ever-changing reality, adapted to the situation as it presents itself.
   The first section of the article focuses on spiritual autobiography and the individual's search for transcendent meaning as an aspect of identity construction. Spirituality involves, among other things, the feeling of interconnectedness with something greater than ourselves, which often includes a search for the meaning of the individual's life. As such, it is a universal human experience that can deeply affect human beings emotionally. Spiritual autobiography is often practised by writers who, towards the end of their lives, focus on the past in the light of universal human experiences in order to make sense of their own lives.
   Especially in autobiographies written in the later phase of an author's life, family and family relationships often play an important role - not only the role of the poet's ancestors and origins is investigated and reflected upon, but often children and even grandchildren form part of a reflection on the future and the legacy of the individual to posterity. It is precisely these poems that are examined in this article.
   Although mede-wete is clearly not intended as a spiritual autobiography, there is ample reason to consider several poems in this collection through the lens of theories on this particular genre, as there are such a large number of poems that correspond to the poet's (Antjie Krog's) biographical details. What is interesting is that three of the poems analysed directly follow on a poem about the poet's grandchildren or other toddlers. Therefore, I argue that there is a rhetorical connection between these "child poems" and the poems on spiritual reflection that directly follow them. It seems that "child poems" often give rise to reflection on transcendent experiences and to the need to explain these experiences.
   Several poems in mede-wete can be interpreted as confessions of faith. In the second section, I discuss the poem "kerssonnet" ("Christmas sonnet") from which it would appear that biblical metanarratives no longer provide modern people adhering to a secular value system with the hermeneutics of trust necessary for a firm belief in biblical truths. In its stead, the speaker, for example in a poem such as "ongelowig is nie die regte woord nie" ("faithless is not the right word"), suggests an alternative paradigm that does not imply a return to traditional religions, but rather a greater awareness of the continuing relevance of religion in secular societies. Such "post-secular" discourse is characterised by individual preferences for particular aspects of spirituality, implying that spirituality is still important, although it does not depend on the hegemony of mainstream discourse.
   In a post-secular world, new metaphors must be found to talk about God. In "ongelowig is nie die regte woord nie" ("faithless is not the right word") the following metaphor is significant: "we all drink like babies at a breast we feel / the nipple between our gums and say: it's / God (...)". By means of this metaphor, then, postmodern feminist discourse enters the poem - a discourse that refers to Julia Kristeva's theory of the mother as abject. Abjection here is the personification of the radical Other, the non-Self - or God.
   The poem "'n eland staan by 'n kuil" ("an eland stands at a pool"), discussed in the third section, depicts a mystical experience, an ecstatic moment in which the speaker comes into direct contact with the Holy One and feels herself, in a mystical way, being united with the universe. It is interesting to note that the eland is considered by San people to be a sacred animal, but that it is also the animal associated with rites of passage and initiation. My argument being that one can also read this poem as the creed of a newly initiated, someone who begins to walk a new spiritual path. The poem expresses the insight, which also underlies the whole volume of poetry, that all things created are interconnected.

AB This study is designed to test the hypothesis that events like the Holly Bough service held in Liverpool Cathedral on the fourth Sunday of Advent that attracts a wide range of participants, including regular churchgoers and occasional (sometimes annual) visitors, contribute significantly to the psychological health and well-being of these participants. At the Holly Bough service held in 2019, a total of 383 participants (139 men, 229 women and 15 individuals who preferred anonymity) completed a recognised measure of psychological health and well-being (the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire) whilst they were waiting for the service to begin and again during a 5-min organ improvisation just before the close of the service. The data demonstrated a significantly higher score on the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire at time 2 than at time 1, suggesting that the experience of the service functioned as an agent of psychological health and well-being.
   Contribution: Situated within the science of cathedral studies, this paper confirms by means of a repeated-measure study that cathedrals promote psychological health; 383 participants at a Christmas service completed the same well-being measure before and after the service, with a significant increase in scores at time two.

AB This paper examines the changing interconnection between the temporal and the spatial dimensions of the secular. It argues that the contemporary crisis of Western secular modernity, and of the secularist philosophy of history that went with it, has opened up the space to study the heterogeneity of the secular and simultaneously forces every form of political secularism, as the doctrine that has the task of defining the proper place of religion in public spaces, to self-redefinition. The analysis is embedded in a comparative analysis of three different patterns of secularization: the Nordic Protestant, the Southern Latin Catholic and the American. The Nordic pattern is characterized by a peculiar integration of the religious and the secular, which is manifested in the fusion between church (ecclesiastical institution), state and nation. The Latin Catholic pattern of laicization is characterized by a rigid separation of the religious and the secular and by civil-ecclesiastical and laic-clerical antagonism. The United States offers a third dynamic of secularization without confessionalisation. With laicist France it shares a secular separationist model of disestablishment of ecclesiastical religion at the state level, while radicalising the Protestant model of diffusion of the religious and secular boundaries in society. The key to the American model is the dissolution of the ecclesiastical national church institution and the proliferation of the sectarian model of free voluntary religious associations without any state interference.

AB Some contemporary teachers of medieval studies have observed that, given the changing role of religious belief in our increasingly secular Western society, any widely shared body of knowledge among undergraduate students about Christian ethos and history is becoming less and less of a given and that, furthermore, this lack of familiarity with Christian tradition poses significant challenges to our work in the classroom to promote curiosity about and exploration of a medieval past deeply rooted in that tradition. The comments here, from a participant in a roundtable discussion entitled, "Teaching Medieval Studies in the Increasingly Secular Classroom," that featured educators from range of types of institutions in the U.S., first offer his perspective on and assessment of these challenges, as professor in an English Department at a small liberal arts college, then note the possibilities for building new interest in the field, and lastly suggest approaches to these challenges based on pedagogy, practices, and teaching strategies that will enhance our understanding of the new audiences in our classrooms, welcome inquiry from them as new learners and curious 'outsiders,' and help them establish the rich contexts and matrices that will be of benefit as they delve more deeply into some of the more unfamiliar aspects of medieval studies.

DE Paris in the Middle Ages; charity; wills; royal officers
AB The article shows the dynamics of the development of medieval society through changes in the composition of orders on the wills of secular persons. These changes are investigated on the basis of the corps of wills of royal officers from the archives of the Parlement of Paris. Initially, medieval wills were purely spiritual and were designed to ensure the salvation of the soul of the testator through gifts for church services and charity. By the end of the 14th - beginning of the 15th century in wills were appeared donations in favor of the city of Paris and its inhabitants. The money goes to churches and parishes, almshouses and hospitals, poor people, widows, unmarried women, prisoners and students. This purely secular charity testifies to the perception of the capital of the French kingdom as a united community. Testaments show the expansion of the topography of charitable institutions in the capital of France. Royal officers range themselves as protectors of the common good and follow this rhetoric in their wills.

AB In this paper, I explore the effects of religious denomination and patterns of church-going on the construction of political values for high-school students. I argue that religion plays a role in the formation of political attitudes among teenagers and it influences their political participation. I examine whether this relationship is constructed along denominational lines.
   From a theoretical perspective, previous research heralded the compatibility between Western Christianity and the democratic form of government. Samuel Huntington, in his famous Clash of Civilization, argued that there is a natural symbiosis between Western Christianity and democratic forms of government, going insofar as to separate the world into religious civilizations. 1 While, this approach essentializes religion as a fixed and immutable entity, Huntington also neglects the importance of dynamic historical, political and social contexts that can, and, in fact, do affect the functioning of religion in different countries, and hence their ability and willingness to accommodate democracy. Much research followed the Clash of Civilizations, either qualifying the central argument, by showing evidence of support for procedural democracy in most of the World, but without its liberal component or even arriving at the opposite conclusion that irrespective of religion, every country is "democratizable".(2) While I do not attempt to disconfirm fundamental huntingtonian thinking, I do raise the questions of how context can and does influence the intimate relationship between religion and politics. The analysis is conducted on survey data collected by the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD) at Babes-Bolyai University with subjects of 14-15 years old, and the results show that, while Greek Orthodox students do not seem to differ in their political values form their Catholic and Protestant counterparts, they are more prone to participate politically. Nevertheless, their active participatory behavior is only more pronounced in what voting is concerned, an opposite effect being recorder for any other acts of political participation.

AB The article is devoted to the philosophical understanding of faith in the post-secular world in the context of the phenomenon of interfaith pilgrimage: from the humanism of the Renaissance and Enlightenment (Goethe) to the religion of the laity and religious consumerism in the philosophy of postmodernism. Goethe's model of individual religiosity in the face of challenges to traditional faiths (migration crisis) and the spread of post-secular, poor theology on a global scale as the world-view of a liberal democratic society (exotic churches, evangelics, charismatics, etc.), and also the process of psychologization, even the mythologization of traditional religions, the movement towards a "religion without grace" can be the sought-after alternative, which is a balance between tradition and innovation; and the religious and philosophical worldview of Goethe, conceptually meaningful, is the new horizon of philosophizing after the post-philosophy.

AB In talking about the topic of musical translations across the Mediterranean, one needs to be specific about what one is meaning by translations. I am meaning the transfer of a genre of musical tradition which is 'secular' and its adoption for a religious framework. In fact, we have three cultures, French, Italian and eventually English being adopted in Malta for religious usage. Sometimes, this involved controversy as a secular, anticlerical music was being given a religious significance, creating controversy in Malta. Again, Anglican and Imperial tradition (Elgar, for example) was being used for Catholic Music. I will be writing explicitly about this in Malta through the music that was played in churches during colonial times. At a time when there were no recordings or concert halls in Malta (and theatre was serving the few) the common people listened to music (and the new trends in music) mainly in churches. Obviously this was a source of controversy.

AB This article contributes to the field of anthropometric history, recently of great interest to social and economic historians. An analysis of the height of adult males in Spain's interior provides a reflection of the nutritional state and biological wellbeing of the society of that region during Spain's industrialization. Some 29,000 registers relating to military drafts between 1830 and 1940 provide a series of samples of the rural and urban populations of Castilla-Leon which allow for an analysis of territorial, environmental, and social inequalities, as well as cyclical changes. This analysis reveals that height in this region developed according to a cyclical model determined by environmental and economic factors, diminishing during the second half of the nineteenth century, when malnutrition and under-nutrition were more prevalent in Castilla-Leon than in other Spanish regions, and not picking up again before the early twentieth century. This reduction in height was more evident in urban environments and among day-labourers. The nutritional status of this region's population improved significantly during the first half of the twentieth century. Although it was affected during the Civil War and post-war period, this decline was not as great as that experienced in other regions of Spain.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that Australia's first two universities were connected to class status. It challenges the idea that these universities extended the "educational franchise" at their outset, by interrogating the characteristics of the student population in comparison with the characteristics of the population in the colonies. It looks at the curricula within the university system to show it is always "interested", never neutral - it may be unique to the social, cultural, political and economic location of each university, but ultimately it benefits those who hold power in these locations.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research involves empirical analysis of characteristics of university students in Australia in the 1850s, including country of birth, religion, age, previous education and fathers' occupation, as well as population demographics from the censuses that took place in the colonies of NSW and Victoria at that time. It also involves an analysis of the sociology of knowledge in nineteenth century Australian universities in light of this empirical data.
   Findings - Socio-political influences on the establishment of the first universities in Australia highlight the power of conferring legitimacy to particular areas of knowledge and to whom this knowledge was made available.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to using the student data for the first three years of enrolment because in order to make comparisons between the student population and the population of the colonies, the student data needed to be from a time as close to the population census as possible. The Sydney census was in 1851, so student data from the University of Sydney was 1852-1854. The Melbourne census was in 1854, so student data from the University of Melbourne was 1855-1857.
   Originality/value - Australian historiography suggests that early universities in Australia were open to all, regardless of background. This paper challenges this orthodoxy through empirical findings and theoretical analysis.

AB The current discussion about the educational system in our country focuses on the dialectic between a pluralist school model or a model of a plurality of schools. The pluralist school is identified with a single, secular and public school based on the premise of a State monopoly of a morally neutral education. In contrast, plurality in the school system, comprising a variety of school institutions under different ownership, all of which aim to satisfy the fundamental rights and constitutional values of freedom and pluralism, shapes the twofold network of public and private education centres through which the government guarantees the benefit afforded by the right to education and freedom of education. By contrast to those who argue for the application of the principle of subsidiarity in private as opposed to public schools, the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled on the complementarity of both types of school.

AB This paper reviews the variety of (sometimes contradictory) processes affecting religion in Argentina today. It questions the idea that a true Catholic monopoly existed in the past, and suggests that the current advancement of religious diversity in the country does not necessarily entail increasing pluralism (since, following James Beckford, this would mean the positive appreciation of this diversity) but can, on the contrary, cause increased social resistance to new religious practices and ideas. A realistic appraisal of religious pluralism should take into account the degree of social as well as governmental regulation of religion. Therefore, this paper emphasizes the expanding role of different secular agents in the control of religious ideas and practices.

DT Article
AB The institute of secular canons represents an ecclesiastical and corporative form of organization with two main characteristics: on the one hand the strictly formalized and reglemented divine service and on the other hand the individual securing of subsistence for its members by prebends. Thus the canons availed themselves of various opportunities for other interests. In that way the institute became a basis of the development of the state, the administration and the instruction, as well as the social existence of the elites concerned. This contribution tries to show how the institute developed and worked. The institute of secular canons can only be valued at its true worth if we focus on the interweaving of the "world" with the "church" as its deciding character, through which it achieved its own cultural contribution to medieval and early modern Europe.

DT Article
AB The assumption of our roundtable is that an increasing number of students are in need of religious instruction because they come from a secularized society, meaning a society no longer imbued with Judeo-Christian values. I respond by acknowledging that there is a great need for providing information about the way Christianity (and Judaism and Islam) functioned in the Middle Ages, while emphasizing that every student needs it: not only just secularized Jews and Christians but also the large number of non-Western students (particularly those from Asia) who have other religious traditions, and also those students who have had a thorough religious upbringing, because their ideas can seriously lead them astray when applied to medieval societies.

AB Since the secular state does not have a state religion or a state ideology and has to respect the individual's freedom of belief, state teaching of religion (according to Article 7 Paragraph 3 of the German Basic Constitutional Law) has to be pluralistic, differentiated and liberal according to the religious denomination of the pupils. It must not be replaced or violated by agnostic, interreligious or interdenominational forms of teaching, but the free cooperation among several religious communities must be permitted.

AB A content analysis of music videos for the 2008 top-rated songs in four musical genres was conducted in order to gauge change in the presence of religious and sexual symbols since the mid-1990s and to determine if sexual and religious images were prevalent in the increasingly popular hip hop genre. Religious images appeared in about one-third of videos across genres, and sexual images appeared in more than half the videos and in all of the hip hop videos. Hip hop and country videos had the highest co-occurrences of religious and sexual imagery, although there was co-occurrence in each genre. The significance and possible interpretations of the symbols and their co-occurrence are discussed.

DE Emile Durkheim; Moral theory; Social ideals; Secularization thesis;

ID COLLECTIVE EFFERVESCENCE; INDIVIDUALISM
AB The article focuses on Emile Durkheim's complex and changing views concerning the evolution of morality and religion under conditions of modernity. While he foresaw a progressive weakening of traditional religions, Durkheim did not believe that modern societies would lose any sense of the sacred. He was convinced that a functioning morality needs a sacred object at its core. In modern times, with the increasing separation of religion and morals, the sacred object of morality is the human person. The article presents and discusses the account given by Durkheim of the emergence of the moral ideal of the person. It shows that Durkheim's work contains two distinct accounts of this process: according to the course on Professional Ethics and Civic Morals, the modern ideal of the person is to a large extent a product of the state. In later texts, including the Elementary Forms of Religious Life, Durkheim increasingly emphasized the role of society itself: he tried to show, using examples from the French Revolution in particular, how ideals are forged in those particular moments of social excitation he used to call "collective effervescence".

AB This research analyses the documentation preserved in the Vatican archives about the practice of ad limina visit during 1600-1800 in the ecclesiastical provinces of Santa Fe and Guatemala. Sources of information and their historiographical assessment are described in detail. By means of a comparative description of this practice between Guatemala and Santa Fe and Lima and Sucre, I proceed to appraise the frequency, type of documents preserved, and the contents recorded. The previous analysis permits to present several aspects of the state of the church in these ecclesiastical provinces, describing in the concluding remarks features of diocesan churches and underlining the most unique. The account that was sent by he diocesan bishop, as part of the precept of visit ad limina Apostolorum, contained information on his episcopal ministry, the pastoral visit, parish organization, the administration of the sacraments, the missions, the convents and monasteries of men and women and reports about provinces. In addition, aspects such as the ordination of indigenous people, indications about tensions with civil authority, geographical descriptions of jurisdictions and registration of brotherhoods, are also recorded.

AB This article examines the contribution of Catholic political theology to contemporary discussions about a lack of solidarity in liberal constitutional democracies particularly in Europe. John Milbank's interpretation of this lack as indicating that secular liberalism has seen its day and should be replaced by a Catholic political order is presented as a viable alternative to attempts at strengthening the secular constitutional state at the pre-political level, as well as to Habermas's deliberative democratic solution. Yet, reading Milbank against himself, the author argues that a Catholic political theology, precisely because it should follow Milbank's suggestions, cannot seek to replace the present sociopolitical order. Instead, Catholic political theologians should discern where the truth breaks through in this order, where people can act in surprising solidarity with each other even if this conflicts with their political views.

AB The research offers an insight into the development of the Ecclesiastical Province of Lima, highlighting the peripheral dioceses, namely Quito, Arequipa, and Santiago de Chile. The study shows how the attributes of autonomy and the collegial character of the bishop's profile allowed the peripheral dioceses of this Ecclesiastical Province to solve the challenges of maturing and consolidating ecclesial structures more efficiently. These processes were strengthened with the influence of the Council of Trent in the patronage laws, especially those related to reforms, such as the residence and pastoral visit of the bishop, the foundation of seminaries and the celebration of diocesan synods or provincial councils. These aspects have been found analyzing the reports of the Visita ad timing Apostolorum that bishops sent to Rome, every ten years, according to the rule promulgated by Sixtus V in 1585.

DE Foundations of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics; Russian school;

AB The article publishes an analysis of opinions of teachers in the subject Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics in the secondary school in Russia. The relevance of the study is due to the necessity of empirical verification of already proposed and existing worldview-related and methodological approaches in the sphere of religious education. The study included in-depth interviews with teachers, assessment of children's knowledge, attendance of classes and workshops of teachers, interviews with teachers of further education courses, with university teachers specialising in religious studies and theology, as well as with researchers in theology. The project is region-specific; the article uses results of surveys and interviews carried out in St. Petersburg and Leningrad Region. Several pieces of evidence ae compared with results of surveys in other Russian regions. The main findings are as follows. The study reflects the contemporary Russian teacher with typical social and demographic characteristics; the modules of the Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics are taught by primary school teachers; most of them are positive about the introduction of this school subject; according to studies in St. Petersburg and Leningrad Regions, most teachers prefer non-confessional general modules; study materials are usually evaluated positively, but it is mentioned that they may have drawbacks in terms of the contemporary means of presenting information and in terms of the perception and demands of present-day students; most teachers have attended additional courses in the subject and evaluated them as useful, but said that they still do not have enough knowledge in religious cultures; interaction with religious institutions when teching modules in specific religious cultures is rare, the most successful interaction of this kind is seen in confessional schools; parents can discuss and choose the module in Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics in parents' meetings; the teachers say that in these meetings parents were offered an opportunity to discuss and select the module of Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics, any coersion being absent, but the role of the teachers is decisive. The main conclusion is that the implementation of the Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics has gone through the formative stage and has gone over to the stage of discussing the content of the modules and accumulating the experience in teaching practices.

AB This article contains five main topics. Firstly, the aim is to briefly describe the number of Christians and the characteristics of Christian development in China through four periods. Secondly, the aim is to describe the characteristics of the contemporary Chinese context through a metaphor constructed by me for this purpose. It is of a flying dragon with one-head-twowings-four-feetandone-tail. Thirdly, the aim is to explore three challenges and opportunities by describing the legislative limitations to the "selfish wild horse of capitalism" and the Levithan of Bureaucracy. This is done by using the metaphors of rope and cage. The role of Christianity within the contemporary secular and humanistic society is also discussed with the aid of a metaphor, that of a "rescuing pill". Finally, the article has focused on the challenges and opportunities for Christianity in contemporary China through an analysis of political theology, cultural theology (especially identity) and humanistic theology ( especially as related to Christianity's pragmatic and secular functions in contemporary China).

AB The festivals, during the eighteenth century, played an important role in the daily religious and lay institutions, among which the Third Orders of St. Francis. These associations organized distinct celebrations in order to promote the institution in the local religious field, spread their devotions, and at the same time broaden their recruitment. This article examines some elements of the celebrations held by the Third Orders of St. Francis in different cities of the Portuguese empire (Braga and Sao Paulo), aiming to understand the meaning and value attributed to the celebrations inside the churches by these associations. To perform this study were primarily used the accounting books of the institutions in order to glimpse the investment in the celebrations and their characteristics. From the gathered information we find a large spending with the ceremonies and the maintenance of worship by the Third Orders of St. Francis, indicating the importance given by these associations to celebrations and festivals performed in their temples.

DT Article
AB One of the prominent features of medieval society was the fight over sovereignty between the ecclesiastical and secular powers. During the period of the fight a number of works were written that supported either side of the conflict based on arguments often originating from the same source, often even from the same author. To a certain extent such was the case of the work of Thomas Aquinas; his thoughts were used to support both Papal and secular demands. The article analyzes the ways in which Thomas's writing De regno ad regem Cypri could have been utilized by both sides.

   religion; post-secular; Czech Republic; Together towards Life; Arusha;

ID MISSION; RELIGION; MARGINS
AB The present era, often referred to as post-secular, has in many places seen a resurgence in spirituality. Nevertheless, the contemporary quest for spirituality is unique in the sense that many people do not expect to have their spiritual needs fulfilled within the structures of organized religion, starting on a journey of their own explorations instead. Sociologists of religion, therefore, tend to employ the "dwellers" and "seekers" paradigm to account for this phenomenon. This paper will explore this phenomenon in the context of the Czech Republic, whose citizens are frequently characterized as distrustful toward institutional religiosity, through the lens of the recent World Council of Churches' affirmation on mission and evangelism, Together towards Life: Mission and Evangelism in Changing Landscapes (TTL). For our purpose, the statement's emphasis on both "transformative spirituality" and "mission from the margins" will be of central importance. Using the notion of transformative spirituality as the energy engendered by the Spirit for the transformation of life and creation, it will be suggested that "seekers" can be agents in God's mission of liberation, reconciliation, and transformation, despite their inability or unwillingness to identify themselves with the church as institution. Keeping in mind ethical considerations, the paper will not seek to make a case for a forced "christening" of the seekers. Rather, it will argue that they can become partners in missio Dei, thus giving the notion of "mission from the margins" a new, contextually relevant dimension.

AB A hot sociopolitical issue today is the extent to which religions should be publicly represented. This text discusses the "state of the question" critically focusing on the main and common argument used by all the experts: liberty of conscience understood as freedom of choice. We are not allowed to identify both kinds of freedom without erasing the necessary division between religion and politics. Nevertheless, the elimination of this division not only occurs in practice but also in the theoretical outlines of the advocates of secularism based on freedom of choice. As the whole question concerns the "monotheism of reason", the philosophical discourse should not be a simple mediator between the different parts.

TI Zoned secular: Seattle's prohibition of new Religious facilities in
   industrial zones violates the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized
   Persons Act's "equal terms"rule
SO WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The "equal terms" rule of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) prohibits federal, state, and local governments from enacting land use regulations that place religious assemblies or institutions on less than equal terms with non-religious assemblies or institutions. The plain language of RLUIPA makes it clear that the equal terms rule prohibits unequal treatment of religious assemblies and institutions as compared to non-religious assemblies and institutions. RLUIPA's legislative history further reveals that Congress enacted the equal terms rule to counter zoning laws that favor secular assemblies and institutions over religious assemblies and institutions. Accordingly, federal courts have interpreted the equal terms rule to require that zoning laws treat religious assemblies and institutions no less favorably than non-religious assemblies and institutions, except where such laws are narrowly tailored to advance state interests of the highest order. In Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that a zoning law allowing private clubs and lodges in a business district while prohibiting synagogues and churches violated the equal terms rule. The Midrash court further held that the zoning law was not narrowly tailored because private clubs and lodges did not further the purpose of the business district any more than synagogues and churches. The city of Seattle prohibits the establishment of new religious facilities in industrial zones, while allowing the establishment of new lecture and meeting halls and new community centers. This Comment argues that Seattle's disparate treatment of religious facilities as compared to lecture and meeting halls and community centers violates the equal terms rule under a plain reading of RLUIPA, as supported by the Act's legislative history. In fact, Seattle's laws are analogous to a number of zoning laws that were amended in response to equal terms lawsuits. Seattle's laws also bear close resemblance to the law at issue in Midrash. Under Midrash, Seattle's laws are not narrowly tailored to advance interests of the highest order because religious facilities, lecture and meeting halls, and community centers are all similarly unrelated to Seattle's goal of promoting industrial development.

ID NEW-AGE; YOGA
AB Affiliation in Australia's institutional religions has declined but there is much interest in Self-Spirituality which is characterised by being person-centred, holistic, eclectic, informal and de-institutional. Practitioners seek transformation through various kinds of embodied spirituality (e.g. yoga, mindfulness meditation, Neo-Pagan). The body may be a starting point for self-care or the body is integral to experiencing transformed emotional and spiritual states. Australian local churches may rediscover a Christian heritage of embodied spirituality, and develop missional responses to Self-Spirituality. An embodied spirituality may be developed from resurrection theology which emphasises the whole person. The essay briefly describes some contours of Self-Spirituality with illustrations of embodied spiritual practice from yoga and Neo-Pagan rituals. There is a disconnect in Self-Spirituality between present embodied experiences that emphasise holistic spiritual states and eschatological destinies which de-emphasise the body or an enduring personal consciousness. A holistic understanding of resurrection is discussed as a basis for Christian reflections about embodied spirituality and witness to practitioners of alternative spirituality.

DT Article
DE Synod; Senate; the state; church; episcopate; diocese; problems; control
AB The article is devoted to the formation of the synodal regime of government of the Russian Orthodox Church and related problems in the relationship between secular and spiritual authorities. Attention is paid to the new policy of the state represented by the Synod in relation to the local episcopate. The peculiarities of the organization of the diocesan administration are characterized on the materials of the Nizhny Novgorod region. A brief biography of the local Bishop Pitirim, one of the close associates of Peter I is presented. The results of the analysis of problems in relations between the state and the church in the political sphere are given. A classification of these problems is proposed on the basis of various aspects of interaction between secular and clergy. Special attention is paid to issues related to the status of the Synod and its real possibilities to represent the interests of the clergy. It is shown on regional material that the clergy, under synodal conditions, found themselves in a dependent position on the authorities, both central and local. The author especially dwells on the facts describing the arbitrariness of officials in relation to persons of clergy, interference in their competence on certain issues. It has been proved that the establishment of the Synod and the general bureaucratization during the reign of Peter I changed the nature of church-state relations and acted as prerequisites for the emergence of new difficulties.

DE bioethics of pastoral counseling; Christianity's place in the secular

   flourishing; respectful acceptance
AB This introduction discusses the various respects in which the turn to psychotherapy and psychology in pastoral counseling touches on issues of bioethics (as the content of such counseling) and medical morality (insofar as the spiritual dimension addressed in pastoral care impacts the medical condition of those cared for, and the various kinds of psychotherapy relate to the therapy offered by medicine). A short characterization of each essay contained in this issue of Christian Bioethics highlights the major subjects on which these essays agree and disagree. These subjects concern the significance of psychotherapy and psychology for (1) reaching out to parishioners who are estranged from the church, (2) criticizing religion as a whole, and (3) remedying certain distortions for which pastoral care and counseling have been criticized in some Christianities. Problems that arise from the incompatibilities between different sorts of theological and psychological accounts of human flourishing and their suggested solutions are considered. The introduction, then, concludes by briefly discussing the different understandings of tradition and church that inform the various post- and extra-Enlightenment positions adopted by the authors.

AB The trajectory of the Catholic economists in Argentina through the twentieth century shows notorious transformations in their religious and professional identities. From the foundational work of the social catholic Alejandro Bunge and the Corporacion de Economistas Catolicos in the late thirties, and after the end of Peronist decade that divided them, their intelectual horizons changed, and the way of connecting economic knowledge and religious belief too. The "social question" lost the previous relevance and coexisted with a secular professionalization related to different orientations, even if the "ethical" bias characterizing the self-identity of the catholic economists supporting the social doctrine of the Church remained alive. The development of economic studies in the Universidad Catolica Argentina deplaced the visibility of the Corporation and the economist of catholic belief circumscribed to the individual faith, and secularizing it, the strong link between knowledge and belief that authors like Francisco Valsecchi still considered essential.

Dimensions of values are extracted by applying nonlinear principal component analysis, with asigning ordinal level of analysis. We present three-dimensional solution which separates dimension of survival/self expresion values into two dimensions. The deviations from the two-dimensional model were interpreted in accordance with the theory of revised modernization and thesis about value change in dependance of sociocultural paths of developement of society.

AB This article presents evidence for a rising emancipatory spirit, across generations and around the world, in a life domain in which religion hitherto blocked emancipatory gains: sexual freedoms. We propose an explanation of rising emancipative values that integrates several approaches into a single idea-the utility ladder of freedoms. Specifically, we suggest that objectively improving living conditions-from rising life expectancies to broader education-transform the nature of life from a source of threats into a source of opportunities. As life begins to hold more promise for increasing population segments, societies climb the utility ladder of freedoms: practicing and respecting universal freedoms becomes increasingly vital to take advantage of rising life opportunities. This trend has begun to spill over into a life domain in which religious norms have until recently been able to resist emancipatory gains: sexual freedoms. We present (1) crossnational, (2) longitudinal, (3) generational and (4) multilevel evidence on an unprecedentedly broad basis in support of this theory.

AB This article studies the reception of the Royal Seal of Carlos IV in the city of Guatemala in the late eighteenth century. It is based on the Breve Relacion written by Dominican father Carlos Cadena (1793). We explore the rhetorical and ideological keys of this original text. We also have used the inform send by the district court of Guatemala that has been kept on the General Archive of Central America. The paper distinguished three phases. In the first part, we explore the forgoing records of this ceremony in others American cities starting from the sixteenth century. In the second part, we focus on the study of the "ephemeral" decorative program. Finally we emphasized the ceremony of the entry, public exhibition and civic oath of the Royal sign.

TI Exploring the approaches to care of faith-based and secular NGOs in

   involved in sex work

DT Article

AB Purpose - Faith-based organisations (FBOs) and secular NGOs provide important services to victims of trafficking, exploitation, and those involved in sex work, yet comparative analysis of their approaches to care has lacked attention in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to examine these two types of organisations, exploring the extent to which faith influences the ways FBOs work with their clients.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 41 interviews were conducted with leaders of 13 Christian FBOs and 12 secular NGOs in Cambodia, and organisational mission statements were reviewed. An input-output conceptual model was used as a framework to gather and analyse data.
   Findings - While all FBOs maintained a high regard for their clients' spiritual needs and operated with a faith- related approach to care, secular NGOs also, at times, included culturally embedded religious elements into their programming. The nature of FBOs' faith-related programming, however, clearly distinguished these organisations from their secular counterparts. Despite such distinctions, similarities were maintained among both types of organisations in the behavioural or recovery outcomes they sought in their clients.
   Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the study's focus on organisations that serve a specific clientele in one development context. Research implications include the study pointing to the necessity of acknowledging the development context as critical to the ways in which religion may or may not influence the approaches to care of both FBOs and secular NGOs. The paper also contributes insight into the relationship between the non-resource input of faith, and services provided by FBOs.
   Practical implications - Given that both types of organisations sought change in their clients, practitioners should ensure that their organisational approaches to care are conducive to the outcomes they seek. Though organisational policy may stipulate that clients are free to choose whether or not to participate in faith-related programming, FBOs should always ensure a care environment in which clients feel free not to participate in such programming.
   Originality/value - Though FBOs and secular NGOs sought many similar behavioural or recovery outcomes from their clients, the development context in which these organisations worked - unlike some other contexts - and the role of faith "infusing" FBOs, led to clear, observable differences in their approaches to care. The study highlights the importance of taking into account these factors when seeking to decipher differences that may or may not exist between faith-based and secular non-state social policy actors.

   Sacred and Secular; Sustainability Mantra
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; RELIGION
AB In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus unravelled the essence of humankind through the metaphor of 'salt', and centuries later, Jean-Paul Sartre named 'nothingness' as the reality of the human being. This article, by drawing parallels between 'salt' and 'nothingness', argues that, though from radically different schools of thought, Jesus and Sartre, in effect, are making the same point that all human beings, irrespective of race, sex, ethnicity, or social status, hold within them the undeniable potential to question and negate the status quo to bring about a sustainable change in the world. Adopting 'salt and nothingness' as a single mantra could effectively conceive development plans and actions to curb extreme inequalities, thereby fostering a sustainable society. By exposing the relevance of Jesus' word in today's world, the article emphasises the need to bridge the gap between the 'sacred' and the 'secular' so that religious values can be effectively incorporated into achieving United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030, especially towards Reduced Inequalities (SDG-10).

AB Russian Old Believers phenomenon is one of the most striking phenomena of Russian traditional culture, and they are the subject of numerous studies. However, few studies have focused on the phenomenon of emigrant Old Believers, which is a unique example of traditional Russian culture adaptation to the conditions of a completely alien cultural space. Today the Old Believers in Alaska are the example of adaptation of traditional spiritual principles (which constitutes the essence of the Old Believers) to the conditions of stay in the center of the world of globalization, westernization, scientific and technological progress and post-industrialism. Old Believers' experience of non-aggressive resistance to the world order, overcoming any ethnic, cultural and religious distinction, is extremely important in comprehension of Russian Way today. The purpose of this study is a comprehensive study of worldview, mentality and way of life of the Old Believers in Alaska.

DE court literature of the late 15th century; the transaction from
   manuscripts to incunabula; high and low in medieval culture; the
   perception of the fiction literature; history of reading
AB In the focus of this article are the introductions and the illustrations of the two manuscripts, Chantilly, musee Conde, 654 and Paris, B.N. fr. 2151. The manuscripts were manufactured by unknown masters in the workshops of Bruges in between 1450-1485. Both books content one literary text, but in the course of the preparation of the latest book (Paris, B.N. fr. 2151) the text was principally changed. Both books come from the small isolated community of the secular readers from the circle of the duke of Burgundy Carl the Brave who owned the grounds in the rich and high urbanized North Flanders. The cultural activity of the community resulted in the creation of the original trends in literature, of the structure for the producing and stocking of the manuscripts. The courtiers of the dukes of Burgundy increased the book-reading, created the new texts and adopted the existing ones. The manuscripts in the focus of the article preserved for us the first publications of the Evangiles des Quenouilles. This text is the literary adaptation of the folk legends and signs of the North Flanders. The cause for the creation this unusual text was the curiosity of the courtiers for the folk culture and their intention to experiment with the borders between high and low in culture. In the late 15th century the book printing was already invented. The transition from the manuscripts to the printing books changed both the reading skills and the texts themselves. The article analyzes the function of the introductions and the illustrations of the manuscripts Chantilly, musee Conde, 654 and Paris, B.N. fr. 2151, the books of the transition period to learn more about the popularities of the trends of the perception of these texts by the readers of the 15th century. The introductions and the illustrations of the text created for the secular readers without professional skills for reading and writing help to prepare the imagination of the reader to percept the fiction.

   example of secular and ecclesiastical influences in Habsburg Europe
SO ARCHIV FUR REFORMATIONSGESCHICHTE-ARCHIVE FOR REFORMATION HISTORY
LA German
DT Article
ID AGE; EMPIRE
AB Using the example of the Habsburg lands, the author reformulates the paradigm of confessionalization in the light of system theory. Confessionalization is understood as symptom of a reorganization which deeply affected the entire social structure. The process of confessionalization brought about the disintegration of the hierarchical patterns of feudal society and the slow integration of religion and politics as functionally related systems of action with their own social rationality of action. From the perspective of the prince, the confessionalization of the Vorlande meant the creation of clearly marked boundaries between the secular and the ecclesiastical sphere of influence. This made it increasingly difficult to employ secular titles of possession for ecclesiastical purposes and vice versa. On the other hand, the prince used his religious and secular reform policy in order to bypass the nobility and to bring his princely authority to bear directly upon his subjects. In this way, confessionalization contributed decisively to the formation of a state independent of the nobility. There were analogous developments in the ecclesiastical sphere. The process of confessionalization brought about the reorganization of the Adelskirche and its structure based on benefices into a bureaucratic organization centered on the bishop and staffed by an educated clergy committed to a special, i.e. non-noble, way of life. At the same time, the church succeeded in extending its legal autonomy vis-a-vis the secular government. With the Tridentine reform of piety, the division between the holy and the profane also became clearer in other areas of life. This furthered the separation of the religious sphere from other fields of social interaction. Therefor, confessionalization became possible because it was linked with the complex processes of integration, in the course of which religion and politics developed into social systems independent of one another. Hence it has to be doubted whether confessionalization qualifies as a fundamental process of society. It should rather be understood as a part of a comprehensive and thorough process of restructuring. Therefore, the significance of confessional church-building in the evolutionary process of modernization in early modern society will have to be newly defined.

AB This article offers a general survey of what can be known about the papal acts received by secular collegiate churches in the Flemish area between the late eleventh and the turn of the thirteenth century, despite the effects of time on the sources. It further attempts to identify common trends in the preservation and reception of those documents, in houses whose links with the papacy have long been underestimated, particularly in comparison with the communities of canons regular that emerged and developed during the same period. Focusing on the example of the collegiate church of Notre-Dame of Saint-Omer, it attempts to define the competing strategies of its provost and chapter, at a time when the community of canons often asserted itself in opposition to the individual at its head.

SO BIBLICA
LA French
DT Article
AB Simons surname, Zealot, cannot be understood to carry the meaning of revolutionary against Rome. A characteristic of the ideology of the Zealot party is the transformation of the sentiment of multi-secular religious zeal of the biblical tradition into a political, anti-Roman doctrine. This transformation in meaning is owed to the influence of, among other things, the Fourth Philosophy, which exerted its influence only in the 50s AD. Since the elements required for the foundation of the Zealot party did not come together before these years, Simons surname, Zealot, can be understood only in the religious sense.

AB During the last decades of the 20th century, Western philosophy saw a renewed interest in religion, often referred to as 'the return of religion'. At about the same time, a growing number of anthropologists and historians began to draw attention to the cultural and ideological bias of the category of religion, revealing its roots in a particular phase of early modern European history. This article gives an overview of these significant theoretical developments and explores both the tensions and similarities between the different scholarly traditions. Drawing on both discourses, it argues that we need to rethink the way we use religion as a category for organizing social and political life. If religion can no longer be taken as a purely descriptive category but rather should be seen as part of specific discursive practices, then we need to critically ponder the implications of the ways in which we map certain customs, behaviours and motifs as 'religious' and others as 'secular'.

AB Around the year 1767 more than 4,500 African-American slaves lived and worked on the properties that comprised the vast patrimony seized from the Society of Jesus on the Rio de la Plata. The fragile balance of the Jesuits slave system was evidenced by the investigations on the management of temporalities, pointing out the failure of the Juntas in the maintenance/control of forced labor. However, in the case of Buenos Aires, only the sale of the kidnapped slaves in their condition of "movable property" has been studied. Our work proposes to reconstruct the decisions taken by the secular administration of Buenos Aires in relation to the treatment of this population and to infer the responses that the slaves themselves made to them in the context of post-expulsion uncertainty.

AB From the point of view of the tax geography and paying attention also to the balance of political power, this article addresses the period in which the lords of the House of Velasco, constables of Castile, managed the main tax perceived over the foreign Castilian trade on its northern maritime border: the diezmos de la mar. Taking into account the doubly privileged position that the Velasco family enjoyed along this period - as main seigneurial power in this region and as assignees of this tax-, we offer a general interpretation of the historial meaning that such institutional and political circumstances had on the evolution of the fiscal districts of the diezmos and its customs. A mediated evolution of a whole system that, at the end, had an impact on the brightest period of the Burgos's wool trade.

TI Singing from the Same Hymn Sheet? What the Differences between the
   Strasbourg and Luxembourg Courts Tell Us about Religious Freedom,
   Non-Discrimination, and the Secular State
SO OXFORD JOURNAL OF LAW AND RELIGION
LA English
DT Article
AB This article considers how the approach of the European Union (EU) and its Court of Justice to religion maps on to that of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). It will show that there is a high degree of convergence but that the broader remit of the Luxembourg Court means that its approach to religion will not be restricted to following that of the ECtHR. In particular, there is scope for significant differences between the two courts on the question of a 'ministerial exemption' in relation to the protection of the rights of employees of religious bodies and the question of indirect discrimination on grounds of religion or belief. These differences highlight the degree to which restricting indirect discrimination on religious grounds draws on ideas of collective disadvantage which are distinct from (and somewhat in tension with) the right to freedom of religion and belief as interpreted by the ECtHR which has seen religious freedom as primarily an individual right that applies equally to all forms of belief. The article closes by assessing what these potential differences tell us about the nature of the EU legal system, and the limits of role of rights in providing the basis for defining the relationship between religion, the state, and the law more generally.

AB Ecclesiastical and secular authorities acting for a monarchical centralization of the power has disputed in the scrolls and manuscripts autonomy and values of theirs institutions. This contest took place in the legal and juridical field, revealing some society's organization programs that were in game. From those questions emerged a canonical literature, which Martim Perez compiled in order to bring us his 'Livro das Confissoes', one of the most influent books in late medieval Iberian Peninsula. The excommunication case sentences listed there give us an idea of how concerned was the church about the secular interventions in religious doctrine matters, just when the State armed itself up with rising legal instruments. The Catholic Church was worried playing defense against the extinction of its immunities and privileges, and excommunication sentences could bring some balance to this game.

DE Sacrilegious; archbishopric of Bahia; D; Lu?s ?lvares de Figueiredo;

AB In 1729, Cesar de Meneses, the viceroy of Brazil, addressed a letter to the king Joao V in which he reported two thefts that had taken place at the Cathedral of Bahia. In the first, a gold purifier, worth 150.000 reis was stolen from the chapel of the Santissimo Sacramento of the See. In the second, three ampullas, which together made up a total of 600.000 reis, were taken from the tabernacle. The viceroy considered that the first theft was unpredictable, but the second was due to the negligence of the ecclesiastical justice, which, by not taking all the necessary steps to discover the author of the first misfortune, ended up encouraging its repetition. Based on this case and its developments, this article aims to analyze the interactions between secular and ecclesiastical justice regarding the investigation and punishment of sacrilegious crimes of theft that took place in the archbishopric of Bahia in the 18th century.

In this context, the main subject of the study is to consider conservative fashion magazines within the framework of consumer culture. In addition, the aim of this study is to reveal the similarities and differences between conservative fashion magazines and secular fashion magazines in terms of consumption culture. For this reason, Aysha and Elle journals were chosen as samples. The issues of the related journals published in 2016 were handled in line with the consumption messages they covered. The journals were analyzed with quantitative content analysis method in order to decipher the consumption messages in the texts. In the study, "What is the ratio of articles containing consumption messages to the total text type?", "What is the subject distribution of articles containing consumption messages?", "How much are consumption messages in magazines?", "What are the similarities and differences between Aysha and Eller answers are sought. In the study, it is concluded that the ratio of artides containing consumption messages to Aysha magazine is 70%, the subjects of articles containing consumption messages are generally product, space promotion and fashion, and there are intensive consumption messages in the magazine. In addition, in the con text of consumer culture, it was found that Aysha magazine was not very different from Elle fashion magazine, except for some basic differences.

AB Biblical historiography arose at the eve of the monarchial period and ceased with the demise of the Jewish statehood. Two major trends are extant: a quasi-secular one and a kerygmatic. Various attempts at periodization appear in the historical books. Periodization also features in the prophetic writings. This historical consciousness is not present in etiologies, but at times this lack was rectified. Anachronism is present, but historical sense tried to curb it, introducing distinctions between past and present. An opposed category of historical thought is catachronism i.e., an attempt at describing the past as different from the present. This is done mainly by borrowing features from an alien milieu, e.g. the Sometimes catachronism resorts to sheer inventions, such as the. When sources were available, biblical authors indiscriminately accepted them: legends along historical accounts. At times authors recast sources in order to express with them their own ideas.

AB Karl Barth has influenced Christian theology of mission in terms of his Trinitarian concept of God's mission. His theology of reconciliation retains inter-religious implication in missional context. However, Barth's theology of reconciliation is not explored in the context of religious pluralism. The reason is due to the neo-orthodox charge against him and theologians' one-sided critique of Barth as a conservative-evangelical theologian. In this paper at issue is to retrieve hermeneutically Barth as a theologian of reconciliation who stands for Christian witness to the grace of God in the world of religions.

AB This article refers to conception of legitimacy of politic power in medieval Castile and later, in early modern Spanish Empire, reflected in the "Siete Partidas" of Alphonse the Sage, king of Castile and Leon (1252-1284) and in its gloss composed by Gr. Lopez - court lawyer and counsellor of the king Carlos I (the emperor Charles V in the case of Holy Roman Empire). Jurists of the 13th century construing the well-known legal maxim "Rex est imperator in regno suo" (Decretals "Per venerabilem", 1205, by Pope Innocent III) insisted on the supremacy of royal power not only in relation to imperial but also to papal power. Thereby a king, according to jurists of Alphonse the Wise, was represented as supreme sovereign of his kingdom either in secular and spiritual affairs. In the 16th century the court lawyer of a Spanish emperor, Gregorio Lopez, emphasized the supremacy of imperial power in the secular affairs and papal - in the spiritual. Yet he marked the possibility for the emperor to be deposed by the Roman people, who gave him his power and, by means of the renovated social contract, could recall it.

AB The article focuses on the early reception of the Spanish episcopate to the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, from 1950 to 1959, when the nature of this Priestly Society, united to Opus Dei, was described to the Spanish prelates. The ecclesiastical context and ideas during that period regarding the secular identity and mission of diocesan priests are analyzed. Also, the proposal of the founder of Opus Dei to offer this initiative to the Spanish ecclesiastical world is exposed. Finally, the episcopal understanding of this priestly society to admit priests incardinated to dioceses is addressed.

AB In this essay I respond to John Caiazza's claim for the primacy of what he calls techno-secularism for understanding twentieth-century history. Using the examples of the Taiping Rebellion in nineteenth-century China and Zionism in twentieth-century Europe, I argue that the range of Caiazza's schema is confined solely to the Protestant West with little applicability to other national histories. I argue further for the lack of clarity and therefore the uselessness of the dichotomy of the secular and the religious for understanding human history. I claim instead that, while the category of technology and the institutions of religion are important determiners in human history, they need to be subsumed, without special status, within a broader set of interrelated factors called "culture." I appeal for the academic study of science and religion to give primacy for the near future to the history of science and religion over both theology and science.

AB The article reveals the methods of struggle between the secular authorities and the Russian Orthodox Church against the remnants of paganism in the Christianization of the indigenous population of the Tobolsk North, their evolution during the XVIII - XIX centuries. It is indicated that in the 1710s - 1760s hard pressure on the newly baptized is used to completely eradicate all manifestations of idolatry. This was facilitated by current legislation and the practice of its enforcement. The following punishments were used to eradicate the remnants of paganism: whipping or whipping; link to Kondinsky monastery; the imposition of penance (to study the prayers, put a certain number of bows in the church every day, etc.). The period of "enlightened absolutism" and the first quarter of the XIX century (1770s - 1822) are characterized by a gradual softening of the state policy towards new converts. The approach to understanding what pagan "vestiges" are has changed. Now it is not "devil worship", but a delusion, a consequence of the ignorance of "aliens". In the future, there is a complete rejection of any form of discrimination and persecution for pagan "superstitions", the desire to influence the "misguided" only by persuasion, and the prevention of violence. By the end of the period under review, only measures of pastoral exhortation remained at the disposal of Orthodox clerks and missionaries. The overall evolution of the policy of the state and the Russian Orthodox Church in the fight against idolatry was to gradually mitigate the practice of law in identifying pagan rituals in the newly baptized. These changes were due to the humanization of Russian society, a more tolerant attitude towards foreign faith.

AB The background to this article is the debate on cities as post-secular and super-diverse. The authors question that the concept of post-secular cities usefully sums up the complex processes currently characterizing religion in contemporary European cities. They propose that different historical memories are layered upon one another and they demonstrate how religious diversity and cities mutually shape one another. Based on empirical illustrations from research in Potsdam and Turin, the authors argue that cities affect religion by casting religious communities and their forms of sociality within particular spatial regimes and contributing to the territorialization of religious categories. Moreover, they state that religious groups shape cities by leaving durable architectural imprints on them. In particular, the article develops the notion of formations of religious super-diversity, which involves forms of religious belonging and identity that historically emerged through religious dissent and innovation, and shows that urban space is the iconic arena in which religious super-diversity becomes visible through the ways in which religious spatial strategies interact with cities' spatial regimes. The authors identify three types of spatial strategies - place keeping, making and seeking - each of which expresses and responds to communities' relationship to urban space in different ways. The typology is meant to serve as a tool to read complex processes taking into consideration both historical paths and contemporary religious formations.
   Resume Le present article s'inscrit dans le debat sur la post-laicite et l'extreme diversite dans la cite. Les auteurs contestent le concept de villes postlaiques qui vise a reduire la complexite des processus religieux dans les villes europeennes. Ils proposent d'imaginer les differentes memoires historiques sous la forme de couches superposees et ils montrent comment la diversite religieuse et la cite se faconnent mutuellement. partir d'illustrations empiriques tirees de recherches menees a Potsdam et a Turin, cet article suggere que les villes influencent la religion en faconnant les communautes religieuses et leurs formes de sociabilite dans des regimes spatiaux particuliers et contribuent a la territorialisation des categories religieuses. En outre, ils affirment que les groupes religieux faconnent les villes en y laissant des empreintes architecturales durables. Cet article precise la notion de formes d'extreme diversite religieuse dans le cadre d'appartenances et d'identites religieuses fondees sur la dissidence et l'innovation religieuses et montre que l'espace urbain constitue l'arene emblematique oU s'affiche l'extreme diversite religieuse par le biais de l'interaction entre les strategies spatiales religieuses et le regime spatial des villes. Les auteurs identifient trois types de strategies spatiales : garder la place, faire la place et chercher la place. Chacune de ces strategies repose sur des types differents de rapport des communautes avec l'ordre de l'espace urbain. Cette typologie vise a fournir un instrument de lecture des processus complexes integrant les parcours historiques des manifestations religieuses contemporaines.
   Resumen El telon de fondo de este articulo es el debate sobre las ciudades como post-seculares y super diversas. Los autores cuestionan la utilidad del concepto de ciudades post-seculares para sintetizar los complejos procesos que caracteriza actualmente la religion en las ciudades europeas contemporaneas. Proponen pensar diferentes memorias historicas como en capas que se superponen y demostrar como la diversidad religiosa y las ciudades se conforman mutuamente. Sobre la base de ejemplos empiricos de investigaciones en Potsdam y Turin, argumentan que las ciudades afectan la religion moldando comunidades religiosas y sus formas de sociabilidad dentro de determinados regimenes espaciales y contribuyendo a la territorializacion de las categorias religiosas. Por otra parte, afirman que los grupos religiosos dan forma a las ciudades al dejar en ellas huellas arquitectonicas duraderas. En particular, el articulo desarrolla la nocion de formaciones de super-diversidad religiosa, que implica formas de pertenencia religiosa e identidad que historicamente surgieron a traves de la disidencia religiosa y la innovacion, y muestra que el espacio urbano es el escenario emblematico en el que super-diversidad religiosa se hace visible a traves de las formas en que las estrategias espaciales religiosas interactuan con regimenes espaciales de las ciudades. Los autores identifican tres tipos de estrategias espaciales - buscar, hacer y mantener un lugar - cada uno de los cuales expresa y responde a la relacion de las comunidades con el espacio urbano de diferentes maneras. La tipologia esta destinada a servir como una herramienta para leer procesos complejos, teniendo cuenta tanto los caminos historicos como las formaciones religiosas contemporaneas.

AB In order to address the serious problem of reform of the secular clergy, the Council of Trent took action in relation to the education of future priests, by decreeing the foundation of a seminary in every diocese. The burden of the work lay with the bishops who were particularly active in Italy in the early post-conciliar period, under the example of the Archbishop of Milan, Carlo Borromeo. However the process of establishing the seminaries was uneven, with timescales and methods varying widely from one diocese to another. There were many problems which the bishops had to address to ensure the stability of this new institution, not least relationships with the pre-existing schools and practices in the education of the priesthood. This was the case of the seminary of Verona which was founded by Bishop Agostino Valier in 1567 and came up against the ancient School of the Acolytes and the Cathedral Chapter. This article is the first comparison of these two institutions. Based on the main field studies and available archival sources it analyses their educational projects and internal management processes. In particular, the first period of seminary activity is analysed (1567-1606), together with the parallel process of reform of the School of the Acolytes, with a specific focus on the role of Bishop Valier and two other important bodies in the history of the education of the clergy of Verona: the Cathedral Chapter and the Society of Jesu.

AB The study is devoted to some aspects of the development of confessional and secular education in the Eastern Caucasus. The conceptual, theoretical basis for considering the development of education in the region is the theory of frontier zones. Some large fortifications of the system of fortifications of the Left Flank of the Caucasian Cordon Line became the centers of the emergence of the system of secular education and the successors of the system of confessional education existing in the region. The study shows the relationship between confessional and secular education for the region; they are by no means opposed. The article makes an attempt to reveal the educational vector of Caucasian politics in the 19th century, as one of the key ones in the issues of introducing highlanders into the Russian socio-economic, cultural and legal space.

AB This paper sets out the legal and administrative efforts that were made to reconcile the existence of the old and outdated Jewish communities in Moravia with the new conditions that emerged after 1848. The previously envisaged union of local Jewish and Christian communities proved to be unachievable due to the animosity that existed between Christians and Jews and to the change in the life situation of Jews after being granted freedom of movement, and in view of the emphasis on the religious tasks that the Jewish communities had to fulfill. Independent Jewish political communities were established and were given both political-administrative and cultic-religious-charitable roles. This dual function led to considerable discrepancies in many areas, which is why the idea of separating these two spheres of competence became widespread. Although the various state authorities had differing opinions on this matter, the adherents of a clear-cut separation prevailed in the end. In general, however, this was fraught with various problems (primarily, but not exclusively, of a financial nature), which this paper examines on the basis of specific examples from a number of Jewish political communities.

AB As Catholic Action continued to grow in the post-war period, new paths opened for the laity. They increasingly felt called to dedicate their lives to the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience, not as vowed religious, but in the world. From 1949 to 1961, Father Joseph E. Haley, C.S.C. (1915-1987) raised awareness about this new form of consecration: the secular institutes. His efforts to develop secular institutes in the United States included organizing conferences, establishing an information center at the University of Notre Dame, publishing various periodicals and books, and founding the short-lived Institute of the Word. Through these activities, he pioneered secular consecrated life in the United States during the years before the Second Vatican Council.

SO TWENTIETH CENTURY BRITISH HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
ID RELIGIOUS CRISIS; CHARACTER
AB This essay examines the sudden re-imagination of Britain as a 'secular society' in the highbrow British media between 1961 and 1964. It is often assumed that contemporary discourses of secularization were relatively unproblematic, simply reflecting reality, but closer investigation reveals that they invented a general crisis of supernaturalism, and exaggerated the extent of religious decline. Between 1961 and 1963 such discourses were promulgated in the British media chiefly by Christians, who still enjoyed a privileged position in the reporting of religious affairs. In many cases such discourses drew on a radical theological critique of the churches which had been developing since the 1940s. From 1963, especially in the wake of Honest to God, the idea of the 'secular society' was accepted by a wide range of Christian leaders, and consequently it passed into the received wisdom, allowing secular sociologists to dominate the debate from 1965. This problematic re-imagination of British religiosity had important secularizing consequences, especially in the fields of the media, the law, and within the churches themselves. For these reasons, Christians played the central role in the initial stages of the religious crisis of the 1960s, and in the imaginative deconstruction of 'Christian Britain'.

We compare the political stance of the former discourse, which has received the least amount of attention in academic circles, with the other two well-researched discourses. The typology offered in this article will be helpful not only in providing a comprehensive picture of Shi MODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RINGi politico-religious discourses, but also in providing a useful framework for further comparative analyses. We investigate the political theology and history of these discourses, as well as their capacity to accommodate popular sovereignty. We argue that while both orthodox and reformist Shi MODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RINGi discourses embrace popular sovereignty, the linchpin of governmental Shi MODIFIER LETTER LEFT HALF RINGism is divine sovereignty, which cannot be reconciled with popular sovereignty.

AB Using mainly historical-comparative and historical-genetic methods, the question of the interaction of secular power in the person of the governor of the Vyatka province N. A. Troinitsky and the spiritual power in the person of Bishop of the Vyatka and Sloboda provinces Apollos (Belyaev) in terms of resolving the issue of opening a brotherhood in the Vyatka province to work with Old Believers, is raised in the article. In this work, on the basis of archival materials, the process of preparation for the opening of the Vyatka brotherhood of St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker in the city of Vyatka in 1882 is considered. Particular attention is paid to the consideration of the position of the Bishop of Vyatka and Sloboda Apollos regarding the creation of the Vyatka brotherhood. In the course of the study, the authors come to the conclusion that Bishop Apollos was a supporter of the initiative of Archpriest Stephen Kashmensky in terms of creating a brotherhood, but at the same time sought to limit the material base of the brotherhood and create a brotherhood without funding from the consistory. As a result, through the Chief Prosecutor of the Holy Synod K. P. Pobedonostsev, the misunderstanding between the secular and spiritual authorities of the Vyatka province was eliminated, and in the fall of 1882, with the blessing of the Bishop of Vyatka and Sloboda Apollos, the Vyatka brotherhood of St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker was established.

AB The experience of beauty is an important part of the Holy Tradition of the Eastern Church. From the very beginning of the Christian thought, Beauty appears as a notion and a value. However, among Holy Fathers' texts there is none specifically devoted to this topic. Alongside this, in modern history there arose a new trend in secular thought which came to be termed aesthetics, which in a sense usurped Beauty as its own category. Only in the 20th century, aesthetics discarded Beauty, and it has taken several generations of religious thinkers to look at Beauty disregarding aesthetics, i.e. as at a specifically theological problem. This article gives an overview of this process and discusses the theological aesthetics of Hans Urs von Balthasar, the Theology of Beauty of Pavel Evdokimov and David Bentley Hart. It provides a comparative analysis of approaches of these authors to the study of the problem of Beauty and analyses reasons for the emergence of the new trend in theological thought.

AB This article examines developments in the academic study of the relationship between the Bible, religion, and film since 2000. The author reflects upon the status of the 'discipline' of 'religion and film', asking whether or not this area of study has evolved into a full-fledged addition to the religious studies curriculum. In addition, the article offers a brief examination of some representative films that intersect with religion and the Bible, and reviews some of the representative scholarship in the field. The conclusion of the article is that interest in religion and film is strong, and that scholarship is ongoing and productive.

AB We humans have extended culture amplifying our powers. Our genotypes are differentially expressed in phenotypes, increasing our preferring us over them, escalating our worst and best. Our groups are more ruthless than individuals. Our brain/minds are hyperimmense, neuroplastic in advancing our powers in collective technology. We fear reaching a tipping point, a point of no return, pending doom for humans and jeopardizing the planet forever. We humans are the best and the worst and horizontal ellipsis we have blundered into doubly compounded wickedness. We struggle to gain truth, and live with our biases, religious and secular. We are capable of the highest good, exemplified in individuals in their spiritual communities. We can also fall into enormous evil, made worse by our community allegiances. We are well into the greatest experiment ever, an Anthropocene Epoch in which the dangerous outcome cannot be undone, nor the experiment repeated.

AB This essay explores the absolute private/public disjunction, together with the derived radical religious/secular dichotomy, which is the foundation of modern liberal political theory. It argues that in a pluralistic democracy, it does not seem equal or reasonable to ask people to bracket their religious convictions and ideals when engaging in liberal democracy, and substitute for them "the limits of public reason" advocated by political liberals. Civility and mutual respect are not based on a common political basis, but on the proper functioning of political persuasion and the democratic process of a legislative session. If the ultimate goal of political argument in the public forum is to come to agreement on the matter at hand, an inclusivist ideal by being less restrictive in a pluralistic democracy will allow all citizens to express themselves and their deepest values more fully in the political sphere. It finally argues that both religion and the public forum need each other and will greatly benefit from allowing religious voices in the public forum. The essay does not favour the Christian religion when arguing for religious voices in the public forum, even when it at times argues from specifically contemporary Christian theological perspectives.

DE Fides et ratio; relation between faith and reason; Dei Verbum;

AB The following thoughts on the encyclical Fides et ratio on the tenth anniversary of it being released encompass only some of the chosen perspective topics of that otherwise very complicated and layered text. Firstly the article reminds us of some ecclesiastic and cultural reasons that led to the encyclical on the relationship between faith and reason. The article then investigates the reaction that the encyclical came across in the theological and secular public. This is followed by a brief reflection on the first chapter of the encyclical from a fundamental-theological perspective. In the end the article presents some new elements that the encyclical brings in observing and defining relations of vital connections and permeation and mutual independence between reason and faith, philosophy and theology. Current attempts for dialogue between Christian faith and those representing a secular mind as well as new motivation for inter-religious dialogue are confirmation of the prevalence of the encyclical.

DT Article
AB What does the end of traditional metaphysical language about God mean? In conversation with New Testament scholar Andries Gideon van Aarde on his understanding of a postsecular spirituality South African New Testament scholar Van Aarde's explorative search for a new direction in theological reflection is explicated in this article with reference to his discussion of Peter Berger and Charles Taylor's contemporary contributions, which Van Aarde takes as vantage point to articulate the meaning of his 'courage to be a religious person today'. The articulation of his 'courage' to pursue a post-theistic understanding of a contemporary Christian religiosity (read: spirituality) that is non-fundamentalistic, non-populist and post-secular is discussed. At the same time, the basic tenets of his explorations are indicated, being constituted - negatively - by a de-centering of the power of institutional religion and, positively, by the enchantment of a Biblical hermeneutics that does not emphasise a proposition-like and moral code-like reading strategy. Finally, his 'new direction', which finds expression in the articulation of a 'spirituality of living faith', is scrutinised. It exposes the shortcomings in his (individualistic) exposition within the new correlation of modernisation and pluralism, causing it subsequently to bypass the necessary contemporary outcome in social embodiment.

AB Drawing upon a case study on public schools in the city of Juiz de Fora (MG), this article aims to discuss the substantive issue of secularism in Brazil. The paper builds on the current international debate that analyzes the process of secularization under a plural and multidimensional, rather than one-dimensional perspective, which has been modeled on European countries and the United States. We seek to establish a typology based on three paradigmatic cases that may bring us closer to the differing forms and informal regulation of the religious phenomenon in the public education environment.

DE Iran's national history; absence of the Medes; Achaemenids; Seleucids;
   Parthians; "hourglass model"; Kayanians; Sasanians; Alexander the Great;
   religious and secular Iranian tradition; Hwaday-namag
AB It is well known that the pre-Islamic "national history" of Iran (i.e., the indigenous secular historical tradition, transmitted orally over many centuries) knows nothing at all, or as good as nothing, about the dynasties and empires of the Medes, Achaemenids, Seleucids, and Parthians (ca. 700 BCE-226 CE). It is first with the Sasanians (226-651 CE) that Iran's "national history" evinces more detailed knowledge. Instead of reports on the historical Medes and Achaemenid dynasties, accounts of mythical and legendary dynasties, the Pisdadians and Kayanians, are found.
   In this essay, an attempt will be made to explain this "gap" in the pre-Islamic historical tradition, this "strange historical (or national) amnesia" (Ehsan YAR-SHATER) in the cultural memory of the Iranians, with the help of a theory on the structure and modality of oral tradition, based on field research, by the Belgian historian and anthropologist Jan VANSINA. The structure in question concerns a tripartite perception of the past: a wealth of information about antiquity (traditions of origin or creation and reports on culture heroes) - plenty of information, too, on the recent and most recent times and lying between them, a "gap" in the accounts. VANSINA described this phenomenon as the "hourglass effect." This is exactly the narrative structure of Iranian national history; it is evident that the Achaemenids and the other pre-Christian dynasties fall into the "gap" described by VANSINA.
   The same phenomenon can also be detected on the level of Sasanian history. We find there a plethora of information on the founder of the dynasty, Ardasir (reigned 226-241 CE); meanwhile, very few details are known of the kings following Ardasir, and it is only as of Kavad I (reigned 488-496 and 499-531 CE) that we have outstanding historical information.

SO RELIGIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Elizabeth Barrett Browning; The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point;
   abolitionist propaganda; transatlantic; print culture; Christianity; the
   body of Christ; crucifixion; The Liberty Bell; post-secular
AB Despite renewed interest in roles played by Christianity in the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning (EBB), few scholars have discussed her treatment of the body of Christ-understood as both the figure of Christ and his body of followers-in her antislavery poem, "The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point". This article argues that "The Runaway Slave" reworks portrayals of the body of Christ in transatlantic abolitionist print culture. It examines the poem in its original context of publication in the 1848 issue of The Liberty Bell, the Boston-based antislavery annual. As EBB would have known from earlier issues of the annual that she received before writing her poem, its contributors-primarily though not exclusively privileged northern whites-represented themselves as messianic martyrs whose Christ-like suffering would liberate slaves. EBB's poem challenges this self-glorifying rhetoric, in part by making a refrain out of words from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's well-known poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. This refrain indicates that the symbols used by Liberty Bell authors to portray themselves as messianic martyrs might, to those they labor to liberate, seem perversely bound up in slavery and the color binary used to justify it. "Runaway Slave" further suggests that the Liberty Bell's messianic rhetoric, like the slave system itself, parodies Christ's sacrifice of himself for the good of others. In both cases, wittingly or not, whites seek to turn the bodily agony of blacks to their benefit, whether ethical or economic. Stressing that such parodies of the crucifixion only perpetuate racial violence, the poem pursues what we might call a post-secular vision of Christ's body, suggesting that people can through love act as members of Christ outside of any official church body. EBB's poem nevertheless risks trading in the abuses it critiques-a risk, the material history of her poem indicates, of which she might have been aware.

DT Article
AB The essay aims at highlighting the different scopes and contents of catechisms published and disseminated in Catholic Europe after the diffusion of Lutheran and Calvinist doctrines. Though Catholic catechisms and their authors have been largely investigated, little attention has been paid to the deeply diversified regional traditions concerning religious instruction due to the presence or absence of "heretics". It focuses mainly on the Italian peninsula, where in general catechisms offered very elementary notions on fundamental doctrines emphasizing rather moral and social behaviour. However in areas (like Piedmont, Savoy and Lombardy), bordering countries where Lutheranism or Calvinism had rooted, the need to contrast the doctrines of the "enemy" resulted in controversial catechisms that equipped Catholics with a deeper theological knowledge and a more critical awareness of their confessional identity.

This secularisation has already completely embraced the public sphere and is now also encroaching more and more dynamically on the scope of labour relations in private enterprises.

AB Still today, in Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, the three main islands of the western Mediterranean, there is a great flourishing of orally transmitted devotional songs which can be traced back to the acculturation processes brought about by Jesuit missionaries in the early modern era. Adopting an ethnomusicological approach, our essay focuses on some significant case studies, aiming to contribute to the discussion about Jesuits and music both in a contemporary and in a historical perspective. On the one hand, we observe the special consideration given today to some widespread popular religious songs that are commonly regarded as "historical Jesuit heritage." On the other hand, we investigate historical sources, looking for traces of past music practices and hints about the relationships between Jesuit missionaries and traditional musicians. Rather than provide definitive answers, our purpose is to raise questions about the inherent complexity of the interpretation of past musical practices, and about the thought-provoking interconnections between these practices and the variegated music scenarios of the present day.

AB The article is devoted to the reconstruction of the biography of Ivan Petrov Mirchev (Koya). He came to Moscow in 1624, joining the Ottoman embassy of Ali-agha oh and Ahmet-Cheush. He spent 35 years in Russia. The archival material allows us to trace his life in his new homeland in almost detail. He was accused of ecclesiastical crimes, dragged into various conflicts in the "Greek" community, the most influential Greek ecclesiastical and secular persons in Russia stood up for him. At the same time, he himself never initiated conflicts, remaining a participant in the events that took place around him. He had various surnames in Russia and in the Ottoman Empire, fought in the Russian army in various regiments, steadily rose through the ranks, eventually entering the Moscow nobility. This information expands the understanding of the mechanisms of adaptation and methods of naturalization in Russian society of "Greek" immigrants in the 17th century.

AB Schiller's First Virtue Speech, "Gehrt allzuviel Gte, Leutseeligkeit und grosse Freygebigkeit im engsten Verstande zur Tugend?"(1779), designates Socrates as the most sublime spirit ever born to the ancient world. Schiller's choice of Socrates is representative of the views of a number of leading Enlightenment thinkers; including Moses Mendelssohn, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson. All four not only portray Socrates as a practical moral- political role model for the pursuit of happiness in the Age of Revolution, but consciously feature him in parallel narratives in which Socrates (as well as Christ himself) appears as a Secular Jesus, a role model for virtue, national, and global citizenship. The common goal of these narratives is the establishment of a sphere of public authority based on self- knowledge through reason that secures freedom of and from faith and religion in civil and public affairs by relegating divine dictates to the annals of untimely historical necessities.

AB The article raises the question of the implementation of religious policy within the borders of the Vyatka province in the second half of the 19th century in terms of creating religious educational organizations to increase the effectiveness of the clergy with the Old Believer and non-Orthodox populations. Based on archival documents and published sources, the history of the foundation and the main activities of the Ascension Brotherhood on the territory of the Sarapul Vicariate, created to conduct religious and educational work among the local population and provide assistance to other religious organizations of the Vyatka diocese, are examined. The novelty of the study is that a comprehensive review of the history and activities of the Ascension Brotherhood, opened in Sarapul in 1892, is carried out for the first time. The author dwells on the religious and educational work of the Ascension Brotherhood, which was his main business. It is reported that members of the fraternity, with the assistance of the local clergy, engaged in religious-educational readings and conversations, which were popular with the local population. It is noted that this activity was initially supported by the local authorities of Sarapul, but over time, assistance to the Ascension Brotherhood from the local secular authorities became minimal. It turned out that members of the Ascension Brotherhood and the organizers of the readings were forced to continue their activities at the expense of material assistance from donors and support from the clergy of the Vyatka diocese.

AB This article considers the actual problems of teaching about religion in public schools. The implementation of the educational concept outlined in the "Toledo Guiding Principles on Teaching about Religions and Beliefs in Public Schools" (2007) has been the subject of a vivid international discussion. Supporters of the new approach to teaching religion hope that the lessons of modern religious and non-religious beliefs and practices will promote tolerance and mutual understanding. Critics question not only the methods, but even the goal of the new educational strategy: the achievement of social peace in modern complex societies through the lessons of religion. Despite the fact that the context is fundamentally different from Western countries, the appearance of religious lessons in Russian school raises similar questions. What are the goals of the course on religion: indoctrination or the acquisition of knowledge? How does pedagogical theory and practice ensure the neutrality or engagement of teaching religion in school?

DE post-Reformation theology; doctrine of revelation; doctrine of God;
   doctrine of sin; doctrine of salvation; bodily turn; immanent
   transcendence; secular spirituality; rationality; philosophy of
   consciousness; emotion; Sartre; Damasio
AB The article offers examples of a post-Reformation theology which could be described as postmodern, post-metaphysical, anti-fundamentalist, immanent transcendent, corporeal, narrative, holistic and secularly spiritual. As examples of the kind of Reformed belief that is increasingly questioned it examines the doctrine of revelation, the doctrine of God and of salvation, with proposals of how they could be accommodated in an immanent transcendent model. Philosophy of consciousness (with reference to Hegel and Sartre) serves to clarify the transcendentally wired nature of human consciousness. The underlying question is how affect can be understood in a rational, epistemological framework. Human consciousness has to be linked to bodily functions, more especially emotions, to appreciate how religious experience occurs in a secular spiritual context. Narrative is spotlighted as the medium that is pre-eminently suited to convey a holistic concept of religious experience.

AB Medieval people wrote and copied numerous law books, custumals and borough charters, which, however, were seldom quoted or even referred to in the law courts. Many legal historians have remarked on this phenomenon in general terms, but the present author has systematically looked for such references in English lawsuits of Norman and Angevin times. He found a number of cases where local or national customary law was mentioned, and others where specific enactments were followed. In a case of 1088 a well-known canon law book was quoted by one party in support of his claim. Laws and customs were, however, seldom specifically invoked. The author discusses the meaning of such terms as Anglica lex, leges regni, jus militare, jus feodi and patriae consuetudo and finally looks at the impact of royal legislation on ancient custom.

AB Zaatar Days, Henna Nights Adventures, Dreams, and Destinations Across the Middle East, by Maliha Masood, (Seal Press 2007) Travel can be transformative. Change was certainly on Maliha Masood's mind when she set out on a 10-month journey through the crescent of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Turkey. Perhaps the souqs, mosques and nightclubs would hold a key to her conflicted existence as a Muslim American Gen-Xer. At the start of her reflective tale Maliha is two distinct and dissatisfied people: a Pakistani-born 28 year old coming unmoored from her Eastern roots and faith, and a depressed dot-commer bored of living in her parents' suburban Seattle basement. By the end she's bruised from love and battered by cultural missteps but also a blossoming writer, a proponent of the Middle East, and a woman newly confident in both Islamic faith and feminist philosophies. The most intriguing thread of Zaatar Days is the essential conflict of Masood's identity. It causes trouble everywhere she goes - for her, and for people unable to categorize Maliha or grasp her idiosyncrasies as a Westernized Easterner.

DE the lay faithful; secular nature; the common priesthood of the faithful;
   the ministerial or hierarchical priesthood; the participation of the lay
   faithful in the threefold mission of Christ
AB The source of the call addressed to all members of the Mystical Body to participate actively in the mission and edification of the People of God is to be found in the mystery of the Church. The People of God participate in this call through the dynamics of an organic communion in accord with their diverse ministries and charismas. The call has been forcefully repeated in the documents of the Magisterium, particularly in Second Vatican Council documents and thereafter. These Assemblies encouraged all the faithful to build up the Church by collaborating in communion for the salvation of the world. This article analyzes above all dogmatic fundamentals in consideration of the figure, nature, dignity, position and in particular of the lay faithful's salvational mission in the Church. The lay faithful's salvational mission in the Church is realized through their participation in the threefold mission of Christ as a Priest, Prophet and King, wich finds its source in the anointing of Baptism which creates the same dignity and the common mission by all Christ's faithful. It is a participation given to each member of the lay faithful individually, in as much as each is one of the many who form the one Body of the Lord. Precisely because it derives from Church communion, the sharing of the lay faithful in the threefold mission of Christ reguires that it be lived and realized in communion and for the growth of that communion itself. In effect, a collaboration of all the faithful exists in both orders of the Church's mission; whether it is in the spiritual order, bringing the message of Christ and his grace to men, or, in the temporal one, permeating and perfecting secular reality with the evangelical spirit.

DT Article
AB In autobiographies as well as in literary works of the late 18th and the early 19th centuries, the first encounter of young people with theatre is often described in accordance with patterns of biblical conversions or medieval lives of the saints (e.g. in the autobiographical notes by Johann Karl LIEBICH, August VON KOTZEBUE und August Wilhelm IFFLAND but also in "Wilhelm Meister" and "Anton Reiser"). The reason for the fact that analogies between theatre and church could be discussed from the late 18th century only, can be found in the differentiation of the system of art as an independent system in this age. The comparisons were meant to promote careers dedicated to the theatre in the age of change in German-language theatre and to emphasize that theatre, similar to religion, is not subservient to anything. Careers of theatre makers were described as careers connected to a "choice" by art that permitted a life in a distance from banalities of everyday life. It is in rare occasions only that careers dedicated to theatre were interpreted as doomed.

AB Taylorean social theory brings new insights to the debate on secularization in the West. In order to articulate them, this chapter compares it with both the "orthodox" and "counter-orthodox" models. In each case, it explores the ways in which my views criticize these theories and furthers the conversation by explaining secularization, I think, more perspicuously and by proposing new issues. In regards with the "orthodox" model, along with criticisms shared by many about social facts not substantiating its claims, it considers that reducing religion as epiphenomenal misinterprets social facts in themselves, sees structural differentiation as not elimination the role of religious motivations, and calls into question the possibility of a strict secular/religious divide. In regard to rational choice theory (RCT), Taylorean social theory main criticism is to its naturalistic methodology, its views of systems as closed, the way RCT privileges instrumental rationality over others, and its interpretation of religious allegiances based exclusively on acts of choice. RCT is seen as unduly stressing structures in detriment of human agency, and social factors in detriment of cultural ones. Taylorean social theory offers positive arguments into the debate when it redefines secularization as religious change, and brings back the cultural factors operative in that social process, as well as the morphogenetic role of human agency (via social movements). Among the pending tasks of Taylorean social theory it needs to produce a clearer set of criteria to incorporate the results of (less hermeneutically-oriented) studies from mainstream sociology, as well as explaining social movements dynamics.

AB This article examines the influence of Augustine of Hippo on Alcuin of York and illustrates the philological-historical method applied in my analysis of Alcuin's surviving oeuvre. By introducing Alcuin's Epistolae and Augustine's De Civitate Dei, I demonstrate the ways in which we can trace connections to Augustine at various levels of Alcuin's texts. This approach will expose the different purposes of Alcuin's direct and indirect use of Augustine. While Augustine will emerge as heavily represented (explicitly and implicitly) in the content and language of the sources, a distinction will be revealed in the aims of direct quotation and indirect reference. On the surface, Alcuin avails himself of Augustine as an authority and binding guideline in matters relating to Christian doctrine. However, a deeper reading that views Alcuin's texts as a political discourse, defined by content and langitage, shows a more complex scheme on the author's part.

DE Spirituality; Religion; Consumerism; Religious education; Mise-en-scene
AB Following on from the publication in the last issue of this journal, these two parts of the monograph use the construct mise-en-scene for contrasting traditional medieval Christian spirituality with the contemporary secular spirituality that is implied in a consumerist lifestyle, particularly in the way that both are expressed through visual imagery. While in two very different cultures at distinct periods of history, both have been dominated by a universal visual iconography that mediated powerful cultural sources of meaning and values; these were like the pillars that structured a unified social reality for the people of the time, shaping their views of meaning and purpose to life. The dominant cultural imagery in both situations conditioned the perceived underlying narrative or mise-en-scene for life. In addition to providing educators with a way of interpreting contemporary spirituality, the approach illustrates a religious education pedagogy for exploring spiritual and moral dimensions to contemporary living in contrast with the way life was interpreted in the past from an almost exclusively religious perspective.

AB The Good Samaritan parable in the Gospel of Luke (and its re-reading by Rubem Alves) is a good example to show the acceptance which we must have with other people, by the Jesus' question to the law's doctor: "therefore, which of these proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robber's hands?" This paper points some ways to perform an answer by the laic spirituality's concept of Luc Ferry, showed in his work La revolution de I'amour, Pour une spiritualite laique (2010) and the development of triple obligation by Marcel Mauss, in Essai sur le don. Forme et raison de l'echange dans les societes archalques (1923-1924). The thought about these two concepts can guide us toward the (un)interested love of Jesus as a model for a good life in XXI century.

AB This essay contends that Polanyi's groundbreaking effort to formulate a more adequate understanding of scientific knowing by acknowledging its practice of operating on the basis of shared assumptions bears striking parallels to Taylor's subsequent efforts to disclose the cultural assumptions sustaining our sense of identity. Both projects had to uncover normally ignored cultural values and practices sustaining scientific knowing and our identities as moral beings. Given this connection, students of Polanyi would be well-served to explore Taylor's works in order to develop further implications of Polanyi's thought. Given Taylor's later exploration of belief in a secular era motived by his Catholic faith, he offers additional examples of developing Polanyi's thinking for students exploring theological questions.

AB During the ten years preceding the Second Vatican Council, the priests Joseph E. Haley, C.S.C., of the University of Notre Dame, and Jose Luis Muzquiz, of Opus Dei, became leaders of secular institutes in the United States. The history of their agreements and differences reveals a diversity of interpretations of the new canonical figure, linked to a diversity of conceptions of secularity and the way of understanding the vocation and mission of the laity in the world. During these years, Opus Dei evolved from considering itself the model of the secular institutes, to understanding that this figure did not suit its nature. The transatlantic dimensions of the agreements and differences between Haley and Muzquiz concerning secular institutes are also addressed.

   Baptist Metz; Eberhard Muller; Norbert Greinacher; Dorothee Solle; Peter
   L. Berger
AB This paper focuses on the effect of the religious sociology on the churches' discourse of "secularization." The research results refer to transformations within the Catholic and Protestant Church(es) in West Germany since the 1950s. At this point the purpose is not to give comprehensive insight into that topic. Rather, a few general trends are to be considered here.
   The secularization discourses within the West German Churches can be described as a periodization with three stages. In the period from 1945 to the late 1950s "secularization" was used to give an orientation after the devastating experiences of the Second World War. The concept was at that stage most understood in the classical meaning of a religious decline. "Secularization" was the mirror-image of past, present, and more importantly, the future. The chance of a religious revival on the one hand and the fear of a godless communism on the other hand were the main topics of the secularization discourse in the postwar period.
   In the 1960s we can find a kind of "theologization" of "secularization." Based on the work of theologians such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Paul Tillich, and Friedrich Gogarten it was the aim to integrate a changed understanding of "secularization" in the sense of a necessary "Verweltlichung" or "Weltlichkeit" into a "modern" and future oriented church model. The churchly debate was influenced and inspired by the general politicization of the West German society.
   The third period began in the 1970s, but was fully developed in the 1980s. The secularization discourse followed the trend of a scientification of the Churches. The definition of "secularization" was more and more affected by sociological patterns and the theological dimension moved into the background. The churchly discussion benefited primarily from the extension of Church Sociology to Sociology of Religions. This impact of the "sociological moment" improved the future prospects of the Churches, as long as they were willing to adapt to modern society by changing their symbolic, ritual, and institutional form. Already, at the end of the 1970s the first indications of a changed perception of the significance of religion were seen. This also involved attempts to replace the theory of secularization with more plausible accounts of the future of religion.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the schooling formation on the territory of the Siberian province in the first quarter of the 18th century. The process of origin and development of spiritual and secular education in Siberia is characterized. The study was carried out on the basis of an analysis of the decrees of Peter I published in the Complete Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire, which regulate the organization of educational institutions in Siberia. A number of clerical sources of the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts, in particular, the cases of the Siberian Order, are analyzed. Also, to study the topic, materials from the newspaper "Tobolsk Gubernskie Vedomosti" were involved. The authors of the article show that Peter's modernization processes in the field of education were reflected in the life of the Siberian province in the first quarter of the 18th century. It is concluded that the main changes that affected the field of education are associated with the implementation of the reforms of Peter I. The role of the first theological schools in the education system of the Siberian province, the significance of the decrees of Peter I and the activities of the Orthodox Church in their formation are considered. At the same time, it is proved that the political events and cultural innovations of the Petrine era contributed to the formation of secular education and the spread of enlightenment among Siberians.

AB The article describes the controversial correlation of forces in Livonia's fight to retain its status quo. The geopolitical situation caused Livonia, though a sovereign but highly dependent state, to gradually disappear. Livonia's structure was far from monolithic; it was a complex of secular, church, order and city jurisdictions. There were estates that had either lost or acquired rights. Internationally, this European province, whose territory was being claimed by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Sweden, Denmark, and Russia, was incapable of surviving in the intensifying political and military confrontations that dominated the region in the last third of the 17th century.

TI EVOLUTION OF THE STATUS OF LOCAL LAW (ESPECIALLY LAW ON FAITHS) OF
   ALSACE-MOSELLE IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER IN FRANCE

DE local law of Alsace-Moselle; secular nature of the state; legal
   particularism; Constitutional Council; ex post review of
   constitutionality of laws; the principle recognized by the laws of the
   Republic; priority question of law about the constitutionality
AB The author examines historical origins as well as background and characteristics of transformation of the local law in Alsace-Moselle, a region in France which in the past existed under the strong influence (including incorporation) of Germany. This set of specific legal provisions concerns, inter alia, such important issues as Church-State relations. Due to the unitary nature of the French state, on the one hand, and the type of matter which is usually subject to regulations having constitutional rank, on the other hand, the issue seems rather quaint and intriguing, given that these relations are shaped in local law of Alsace-Moselle in a way closer to the approach applied in devout countries rather than in secular countries that after all is France. It seemed that the recent introduction of the ability to exercise ex post review of the constitutionality of laws could pose a serious threat to the constitutionally doubtful position of local laws.. Obawy te zostaly wprawdzie rozwiane przez Rade Konstytucyjna, ktora nadala mu status zasady podstawowej uznanej prawami Republiki, zapewniajac konstytucyjnie uwarunkowana stabilnosc, jednak decyzja ta zostala, jak sie wydaje, powzieta z przeslanek bardziej pragmatyczno-politycznych niz prawno-konstytucyjnej natury. In fact, these concerns were allayed by the Constitutional Council, which gave it the status of a fundamental principle enshrined in the laws of the Republic, providing a constitutionally conditioned stability, but this decision was, as it seems, based on political-pragmatic grounds rather than legal-constitutional arguments.

AB I take the APA publication A Spiritual Strategy for Counseling and Psychotherapy (Richards and Bergin 2005), along with a devoted issue of Journal of Psychology and Theology (Nelson and Slife 2006), as a paradigmatic example of a trend. Other instances include the uncritical use of "Eastern" philosophy in Humanistic and Transpersonal Psychology, almost normative appeal to the "Sacred" within the psychology of spirituality, talk of "God in the brain" within neurological research, the neologism entheogen referring to psychedelic drugs, and calls for new specializations such as neurotheology and theobiology. In response to the legitimate ethical requirements of respect and openness regarding clients' religious worldviews, the trend is to make God an essential component in psychological theory. The argument is that God is active in the universe and especially in human affairs to such an extent that any accurate account of strictly psychological matters, not just a comprehensive, interdisciplinary purview that could include a distinct theological dimension, must include God as an explanatory factor. Less nuanced than standard theological thought about divine intervention-including a range of opinions from supernaturalism, to occasionalism, to providential and deistic naturalism-this trend would blur the epistemological differences between religion and science by appeal to claimed knowledge sources such as inspiration and revelation and thus undermine the achievements of evidence-based science and establish particularistic religious beliefs as standard explanatory accounts. The concern to include a spiritual, in contrast to a religious or theist, dimension in psychological theory is welcome; but elaborated approaches, such as my own and those of Roberto Assagioli, Viktor Frankl, and Ken Wilber, open to varied theological applications, already exist.

   spirituality; symbol; traditional birth
AB This paper looks at the role of art and material culture in the rituals of birth, first taking into consideration research on material culture in traditional rituals of birth and then turning to the primary topic, which is how art in the contemporary rituals of birth often holds sacred meaning even when the ritual is of a nonreligious nature. A discussion about the sacred in the context of a nonreligious ritual hinges upon an understanding of that which is "sacred"; thus, the paper looks at research on modern theology and the sacred to examine the term in the context of birth as a contemporary rite of passage. Giving examples of how material culture has been important in several traditional birth rituals from different cultures, the paper then traces a similar occurrence in which participants in contemporary nonreligious rituals of birth also uphold art and material culture as sacred elements of the rituals. The paper provides the reader with description of a rich array of art and material culture used across cultures in different rituals of birth. Taking into consideration the numerous contributions that scholars have made to the emerging field of birth and religion, including the interdisciplinary importance of theories related to birth as a rite of passage, the paper also presents new research on the materiality of the contemporary rituals of birth.

   Churches (CEC); Charta Oecumenica; Symphonia; Committee of
   Representatives of Orthodox Churches to the European Union (CROCEU);
   Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Union (COMECE)
AB This article focuses on the political mobilisation of Orthodox churches in the making of the European Union from the 1950 Schuman Declaration until today. It examines the first contacts between Orthodox churches and European institutions, the structure of religious dialogue, policy areas of Orthodox engagement in the European Union, and competing visions of Europe in the Orthodox commonwealth. It argues that the response of Orthodox churches to the institutionalisation of religious dialogue in the European Union (Article 17 of the Lisbon Treaty) is comparable to that of other religious communities. However, the political mobilisation of Orthodox representations in Brussels advances a geopolitical and civilisational dimension which places the Eastern Orthodox world as a competitor to the secular West.
